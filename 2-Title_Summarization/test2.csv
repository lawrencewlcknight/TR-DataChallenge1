2,"China will not increase sugar imports
substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints
and large stocks, despite falling production and rising
domestic demand, traders and the official press said.
    ""Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the
last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to
be extremely serious,"" the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986
plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because
farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical
and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.
    The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop
(November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year
earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.
    The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500
tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier
figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China
News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.
    The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province
fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the
area under sugar was dropping.
    ""Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate,"" the newspaper
said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of
nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane
is a major problem.""
    A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,
south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in
area planted.
    He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel
developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the
maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.
    The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province
of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667
hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only
70 from one mu of sugarbeet.
    The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to
4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.
    Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed
with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in
falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.
    The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the
official press has said.
    Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of
sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.
    The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln
tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.
    A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks
in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import
sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986
when the central government resumed control of imports.
    ""As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored
in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas,"" the diplomat
said.
    The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to
consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly
as coal had priority. ""How quickly they can move the sugar is
one factor determining import levels,"" he said.
    Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,
China's major supplier through barter trade, he said.
    ""China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about
152/153 dlrs a tonne,"" he added. ""China is not a desperate buyer
now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into
the open market.""
    A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding
imports was price.
    ""While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,
foreign exchange restraints persist,"" he said.
    The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five
pct a year but ""a communist government is in a much better
position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the
foreign exchange situation demands it.""

well as a better yield from its domestic non-accrual loan

    It said international operations reported a net after-tax

approved a plan to buy up to 2.3 mln shares of its common stock
to offset dilution from conversion of its 10-year notes issued
in connection with the acquisition of Hybritech Inc in March
1986.
    The non-transferable notes pay interest at an annual rate
of 6.75 pct. The notes, which mature on March 31, 1996, became
convertible into 2.3 mln shares of Lilly stock at 66.31 dlrs a
share beginning March 18, 1987.
    Lilly said it will buy shares of stock from time to time in
the open market at prevailing prices or in privately negotiated
transactions.
    The newly announced purchase plan is in addition to its
existing anti-dilutive stock repurchase programs. Under these
programs, the company systematically buys back shares in the
open market to replace shares issued under its stock plan and
acquisition earnout agreements.
    Currently the only other potentially diluting instruments
are the warrants that the company also issued in connection
with the Hybritech acquisition.
    Lilly issued 17.1 mln warrants with an expiration of March
31, 1991. A warrant gives the holder the right to purchase one
share of Lilly common at 75.98 dlrs. Since the acquisition,
Lilly has repurchased 2.0 mln warrants, so there are currently
15.1 mln outstanding.

Committee voted in February to maintain the then-existing
degree of restraint on bank reserves, dealers said.
    News of a weaker-than-expected March employment report and
a minor bounce back in the dollar prompted short-covering that
pushed coupon issues higher, while an easing in the Federal
funds rate below six pct helped short-dated issues.
    The key 7-1/2 pct 30-year Treasury bond price finished 3/4
higher at 95-27/32, pushing the yield down to 7.86 pct from
7.93 pct yesterday.
    Danuta Zielonka of Wertheim Schroder Co Inc said that
recent slowing in the growth of the monetary aggregates is a
another factor arguing against firmer Fed policy.
    ""Money growth has been slowing perceptibly in March which
should give them more room to not tighten,"" she said. ""Both M2
and M3 are will be at the low end of their target ranges in
March.""
    ""The FOMC minutes are neutral for the bond market,""
Zielonka said. ""Dollar considerations will prevent them from
easing anytime soon, but they can't tighten with the economy
weak and the banks having to deal with Brazil.""
    Doubts on the economy's strength were underscored not only
by a smaller-than-expected 164,000 gain in March non-farm
payrolls, but also by a downward revision in February's gain to
236,000 from a previously reported 337,000.
    The market's initial reaction to the data was restrained by
fears the employment news would undermine the dollar, but when
the dollar maintained a firm tone, the bond market extended its
gains.
    Profit-taking pulled bond prices down from the day's highs,
but a record close in the U.S. stock market stimulated buying
late in the day that offset this somewhat.
    Still, coupon issues were unable to recover completely from
this week's steep losses as trade tensions between the U.S. and
Japan pressured the dollar and discouraged Japanese investors
from buying U.S. Treasury bonds.
    The current 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond traded down to 94-11/32
in Tokyo this week, pushing the yield to 7.98 pct. This capped
the U.S. 1987 high yield on the 30-year bond of 7.93 pct, seen
yesterday.
    Treasury bills advanced on the week. The six-month bills
rose one basis point, but three-month bills fell 17 basis
points and the year bill fell two basis points.
    Dealers said that the sharp drop in three-month bills
resulted in part from recent outright bill purchases for a
customer, believed to be related to heavy intervention by
foreign central banks to support the dollar.
    A drop in the Fed funds rate to 5-15/16 today underpinned a
decline in bill rates. It traded at this level throughout the
session, down from yesterday's 6.14 pct average.
    Three-month bills closed two basis points lower at 5.48 pct
bid. Six- and 12-month bills both dropped nine basis points to
respective bids of 5.70 pct and 5.75 pct.

progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which
must not be sidetracked.
    ""We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world

since the ""Uruguay round"" talks last Sepember. The meeting is

benefits, as well as preventing ""bush fires of confrontation

should operate, they said.

    Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be
free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said.
    The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could

would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be

realistically assessed capabilities of our economy,"" he said in

    Yugoslavia is to negotiate a long-term restructuring of its
debt after missing repayments in recent months, Mikulic said.
    ""If we did not change the dynamics of repaying our debt, the
situation would become increasingly worse,"" Mikulic said.
    He said on the present repayment schedule, Yugoslavia would
have a net outflow of two billion dlrs and the level of debt
would be halved by 1995. But he added:
    ""The consequences would not only mean slower economic growth
in the coming years but also further exhaustion of the economy

higher personal taxes as well as wage and price restraint, is

Yugoslavia's ability to eventually repay the credits.

same level as now until 1990 and the country should then be
able to keep currency reserves equal to three months payments.

creditors. We expect understanding and support because it is in
their interest as well,"" Mikulic said.

69,"This month's endorsement by
International Business Machines Corp <IBM> of two desktop
publishing software products should add some much-needed
standards to one of the fastest growing segments of the
computer industry, analysts say.
    Desktop publishing is a relatively new market but industry
analysts estimate that sales will reach one billion dlrs this
year and jump to six billion dlrs by 1990, fueled by the rush
of corporations to bring their printing and publishing needs
in-house rather than to more expensive outside printers.
    Printing is a big expense for most companies. Analysts
estimate U.S. corporations will spend about six to 20 pct of
their total operating budgets on publishing expenses this year.
    At a desktop publishing conference in Chicago earlier this
month, IBM said it will adopt Adobe Systems Inc's Postscript
typesetting language in future electronic printing products.
IBM also said it will support Microsoft Corp's Windows
operating environment as the graphics interface standard in
future publishing announcements rather than its own Topview
environment.
    ""IBM's announcement will give tremendous stimulation to the
development of the desktop publishing market,"" said David
Goodstein, president of the consulting firm Interconsult Inc.
    ""It gives users permission to go ahead and buy products that
are already available without being afraid that they will not
be compatible with whatever IBM does,"" he said.
    The advent of personal computers, laser printers and
graphics software has allowed users to design and print
brochures, newsletters and a host of other communications at
their desks for a fraction of the cost of an outside printing
firm. Analysts credit Apple Computer with creating desktop
publishing when it introduced its Macintosh personal computer
four years ago, with its easy-to-use formats and excellent
graphics capabilities.
     Since then Digital Equipment Corp, Xerox Corp, Apollo
Computer Inc and a number of other vendors have identified
desktop publishing as a major growth area. IBM entered the
market only last July when it formed its Publishing Systems
Business Unit. IBM's embrace of the already-widely used
Postscript, a language that interprets computer commands and
translates them into instructions for the printer, was an
acknowledgment of what is already a de facto standard.
    Both users and makers of electronic publishing systems said
the support of the world's largest computer maker was critical
to the language's ultimate acceptance by users.
    John Warnock, president of Palo Alto, Calif.-based Adobe,
said, ""Ten pct of corporations have (moved) into desktop
publishing but 90 pct are still sitting back and waiting for an
IBM announcement.""
    IBM entered a licensing pact with Adobe for Postscript, but
its support of Windows was not quite so broad. IBM recognizes
Windows as a standard but would not comment on the extent of
its commitment to the software.
    Windows, a program integrator, allows personal computer
users to run a number of different applications simultaneously.

proposing a package of personal income tax cuts worth 102.1
billion francs that would apply from 1989, a finance ministry
spokesman said.
    The package, one of 11 possible tax reform scenarios drawn
up by government officials, is expected to be discussed by
ministers in the coming weeks so that a government draft can be
presented to parliament in October.
    The proposals, which would greatly simplify the country's
tax system, include a cut in withholding tax on investment
income earned in Belgium to 20 pct from the current 25 pct.
    The reduction would apply to income from risk capital, but
the spokesman said this was likely to be defined to include all
shares and bonds.
    The package chosen by Eyskens is more favourable to
families with children than the present regime and would treat
spouses' incomes separately instead of combining them, a
practice that is widely seen as discouraging marriage. The tax
reform does not encompass corporate taxation.
    The spokesman said some 75 pct of the cost of the package
would be financed by changes to the 258 tax allowances
currently granted to diverse interest groups.
    A further 14 pct would be met by higher tax revenues
resulting from the overall macro-economic benefits of the
package.
    This would leave a shortfall of around 20 billion francs,
which the government would have to decide how to cover, either
by raising indirect taxes or by making further budgetary cuts.
    The package favoured by Eyskens, who has described Belgium
as a ""fiscal Himalaya,"" is the least costly of the 11 scenarios
prepared. It envisages three marginal rates, or tax thresholds,
of 30 pct, 40 pct and 50 pct. This compares with 13 currently,

    Still, the U.S. currency remained well within recent
trading ranges because few operators are prepared to go out on
a limb ahead of today's meeting of Group of Five finance

    The overnight sell-off was partly due to skepticism that
this week's monetary talks will yield new or lasting measures

    Total investment this year, the country's second as a

show a surplus of 400 mln dlrs this year compared with 1.13
billion in 1986 and 369 mln the previous year.
    Last year's high surplus was attributed to cheaper oil and

    Imports by volume were forecast to grow 10 pct this year

6.6 pct respectively in 1986, the bank said.
    The forecasts were calculated on the assumption that the
non-expansionary monetary policy carried out by the current

the assumption that the international economic situation and

138,"Senior U.S. Economic officials
disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget
deficit reduction targets.
    Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to
a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting
spending and fostering economic growth.
    By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional
Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the
deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.
    Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University
that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the
desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility
for local projects to state governments.
    He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the
President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to
limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should
be linked more closely.
    Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct
growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and
3.5 pct in 1988.
    Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of
economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, ""It looks pretty
good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports.""
    He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,
""It looks like they're on track.""
    While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,
Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.
    The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax
reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will
greatly increase private production incentives, he said.
    ""Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest
national net output of goods and services will permanently
increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run
consequences of tax reform,"" Sprinkel said. ""In 1986, this would
have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the
income of the average American family.""
    Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible
for the large increase in the budget deficit.
    In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted
to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of
GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.
    Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986
federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points
higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.
    ""Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981
tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget
deficits of the past few years,"" Sprinkel said.
    ""This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax
increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,"" he added.
    However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner
argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.
    ""Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes
enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the
Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence
spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)
are unpleasant,"" he said.
    Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological
turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the ""biggest sustained inflation
in our nation's history,"" which helped foster widespread
distrust of government.
    ""The American people turned on the government with tax
revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at
the national level,"" Penner said.
    ""But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike
of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake
demands that the system change a lot.""
    Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget
deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will
remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.
    He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is
not likely to succeed.
    ""I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to
dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply
because there's no ... Way to enforce it,"" Penner said.
    Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget
deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated
by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes
related to tax reform and sales of government assets.
    ""Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative
timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last
day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved
more than two billion dlrs,"" Penner said.

his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with a

    Nakasone also instructed the government's Economic Planning
Agency (EPA) to work closer with the LDP to work out a
full-fledged economic plan to boost domestic demand as pledged
at last month's Paris currency stability accord by six
industrial countries, the officials told Reuters.
    The date for the government to announce its package, based
on the LDP's suggested measures, is not yet known but it may be
before the fiscal 1987 budget passes the Parliament around late
May, the officials said.
    The government has said in the past the package should come

    But calls have grown at home and abroad for the government
to announce it earlier as budget debates have been stalled by
an opposition boycott of parliamentary business in protest at a

government's stance on the date for the plan remains the same,

145,"Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced
by analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement.
    A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected
tomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A
follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.
    ""Worthy but boring would probably sum it up,"" Peter Fellner,
U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. ""It was
a very, very prudent fiscal budget.""
    Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a
well-balanced budget within the confines of the government's
philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.
    Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal
side, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.
    As was widely expected, Lawson split his ""fiscal adjustment""
between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg
from 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to
27 pct.
    The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was
kept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad
Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped.
    Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for
a half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the
authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately.
Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full
one-point cut tomorrow.
    ""The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which
it will have to reverse later,"" Jeffrey said, though he added a
further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.
    The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for
inflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained
in it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.
    Holt noted the ""rather loose"" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct
at end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result
from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.
    ""A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,""
he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of
falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on
inflation.
    The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but
it was ""not a good budget for inflation,"" he said
    Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about
the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not
too concerned about a revival of inflation.
    Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the
""leading edge"" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were
likely to be extremely cautious on this front.
    He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest
rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any
signs of excessive weakness.
    Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility
of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.
    Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from
1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets,
which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said.
that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by
the favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast
to be 4.0 billion stg.
    But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any
clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election,
which has to be held before June, 1988.
    Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the
benefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise
duties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.
    But others said it kept several options open and it was not
possible to deduce too much from it.
    James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent,
Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in
that there would be no ""chickens coming home to roost.""
    Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June
election, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for
a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory.
    Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost
to the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity.

a debt refinancing with Colorado National Bankshares Inc
<COLC>, the bank will have the right to foreclose on
Greenwood's assets.
    On January 28, Greenwood's board approved an agreement with
Colorado National calling for the sale of 4,300,000 shares of
New London Oil owned by Greenwood for 1,700,000 dlrs and
calling for a restructuring and recapitalizing of Greenwood,
subject to shareholder approval.
    As a result of declines in the value of oil and natural gas
properties brought on by the fall in prices for those fuels,
Greenwood started facing substantial bank debt prepayment
requirements in 1986.
    The New London shares are to be sold to a party in London.
    On February 1, Colorado National released to the company
all cash flow from oil and natural gas operations and reduced
its debt in return for the payment of 1,700,000 dlrs from the
sale of the New London stock and other considerations.  Eighty
pct of Greenwood's cash flow from oil and gas operations had
been allocated to servicing debt to the bank.
    Under the deal with Colorado National, existing preferred
and common stocks would be converted into a new common stock,
subject to shareholder approval.

special meeting of shareholders at which the matter will be
considered by the first week of April, mail material to

seasonally adjusted, rose a provisional 3.2 pct in February
after a downwards revised decline of 3.4 pct in January, the
Economics Ministry said.
    The ministry had originally estimated that industrial
production fell 3.0 pct in January.
    The February figure is likely to be revised upwards by just
under one percentage point next month when the March figure is
released, a ministry statement said.
    The industrial production index, base 1980, stood at a
provisional 104.1 in February against 100.9 in January and
104.5 in December. The ministry had previously put the January
and December indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively.
    In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7,
producing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct.
    The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pct
increase in construction output compared with January, when
production in many industrial sectors was depressed by
unusually severe winter weather.
    Manufacturing industry registered a 3-1/2 pct rise in
production in February compared with January. But energy sector
output fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct.
    The ministry, which considers two-monthly comparisons to be
a better guide to trends, said output in January and February
together fell around two pct against November and December.
    The ministry said construction output fell 13-1/2 pct in
January/February against November/December due to the cold
January weather. Output in the energy sector rose four pct and
mining output 10 pct.
    Manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct in

nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday,
saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from
Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.
    The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO)
will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to
40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital,
the company said.
    ""Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO
regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane
after April 10,"" the mill warned planters earlier this week.
    Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen
months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking
oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer
prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing
hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.
    At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to
receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a
warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound
(45-kg) bags of sugar.
    ""We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar.
We have no money left to continue operations,"" Rigaud said.
    He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an
additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.
    Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier
two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.
    He said the government then began importing refined sugar
at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and
the provisional military-civilian government that replaced
Duvalier last year continued the policy.
    ""But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete
with smuggled Dominican refined sugar,"" Rigaud said.
    HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above
the usual minimum wage of three dlrs.

supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a

    The court had been scheduled to hear arguments on a Texaco

issue was moot because of Texaco's bankruptcy petition filed

currencies with action.
    ""Until today we have anounced policies, but when it came to
action required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody,""
Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura told a news conference.
    ""From now on, if a government comes up with a certain
policy, it must be followed by action,"" he said following two
days of informal talks with the trade ministers of the United
States, the European Community and Canada in central Japan.
    Last week, the dollar fell to a new record low below 140
yen, despite statements from the Group of Seven (G-7) leading
industrial powers that currencies should be stabilised to
underpin world trade.
    ""We need credibility to gain confidence. When we have
confidence, then we can have an impact,"" said Tamura.
    His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought
over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free
trade rules in general, it was not a sight which inspired
confidence in the markets.
    ""The time has come now to act in step with the talk. If you
belong to a club, you have to act in concord with the rules, if
you want to be credible,"" said EC external trade chief Willy de
Clercq. Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney also agreed: ""We
are meeting in a time of great trade tension. What the world
needs to see is that we have the political will to deal with
these problems we face.""
    She said that next month""s meeting of the Organisation of
Economic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leaders
of the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum to
show this will existed.
    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news
conference that the results of such high level meetings could
lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out
world trade imbalances perhaps years later.
    ""The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings
like this in terms of tangible results. That is not the way it
should be pursued,"" he said.
    ""What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceeds
what is achieved in a tangible way,"" he said.
    Progress in personal contacts and understanding each others""
positions and policies was just as important toward reducing
trade tensions, he said.
    Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks:
    Currency stability was now essential, but currency
movements alone would not correct a U.S. Trade deficit with
Japan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year, an 18 billion dlr EC
deficit with Japan in 1986, and a Japanese global trade surplus
of almost 90 billion, he said.
    Trade retaliation, protectionism, and forcible export
restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were
most dangerous, he said.
    The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies
over a whole range of fiscal, monetary, trade and industrial
measures, and in line with a body of internationally agreed
rules, he said.
    In this regard, the policing role of the Geneva-based
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must be
strengthened, he said.
    The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to
solve the problem. The United States will try to reduce its
large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its
industries.
    Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expand
its domestic growth and rely less on exports.
    The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth and
reduced unemployment. All felt satisfied at the new progress in
the Canadian economy.

one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International
Inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a
share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements
Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash
portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.
    Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock
he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.
    The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal
Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that
purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a
share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.
    Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids
from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom
management which is competing with Redstone for control of the
company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.
    The company did not disclose the details of the revised
offers, but said a special committee of its board would review
them later today.
    The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom,
and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both
agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is
completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for
at least half of the outstanding stock.
    The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements,
which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided
they keep the information secret.
    In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of
completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of
America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.
    Besides the financing it would raise through a bank
syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a
separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial
financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs,
Redstone said.
    Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased
its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated
financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs
it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said.
    Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln
dlrs in equity toward the takeover.
    The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would
consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares
and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said.
    The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has
proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also
contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said.
    Last week, the management group submitted what it called
its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and
consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued
at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. Redstone's
previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs.

rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as
part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris,
Finance Ministry sources said.
    They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund
Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,
abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with
the bureau.
    The bureau channels funds to government financial
institutions for public works and other official uses, they
said.
    The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan
Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance
corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in
tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.
    However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,
to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund
Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.
    The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a
market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the
domestic economy, they said.
    On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut
their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.
The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors
using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and
Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of
the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.
    These ministries are trying to determine which market rates
should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,

235,"Automobiles Citroen expects rising
sales of its new AX compact car to help boost profits
significantly this year, continuing a financial recovery after
six straight years of losses, president Jacques Calvet said.
    Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AX
sports model, he said: ""All the budgetary forecasts that we have
been able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvement
in 1987, compared with 1986,"" he added.
    Citroen, part of the private Peugeot SA <PEUP.PA> group,
increased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct in
first two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier. It is
aiming for an average 12.8 pct share throughout the year after
11.7 pct in 1986.
    The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of the
European market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from
2.9 pct in 1986.
    ""Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet the
demand,"" Calvet said. ""This is a relatively new problem for us.""
    Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cut
the deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to modernise
its range and improve productivity.
    Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen's 1986
profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs.
    This weekend he said that those profit estimates ""remain
about the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic.""
    Some of this optimism is due to the early success of the
AX, launched on the French market last October. It will be
available throughout most of western Europe within four months.
    The car has registered just over 20,000 sales.
    It is being built at Citroen's large plant at Aulnay-sous-
Bois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany and
Vigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of
1,000 cars a day.
    The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate model
between its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed to
compete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa.
    The AX had built up its market share in France to around
four pct last month. Calvet said: ""Our hope is that once the AX
is fully developed, we will have between 6.5 and seven per cent

raise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publicly
traded shares of Standard Oil Co <SRD>, analysts said.
    ""There's a lot of speculation here that someway or other
they would be forced to come up with another bid,"" said Rosario
Ilaqua of L.F. Rothschild.
    And despite BP managing director David Simon's denial today
that BP would raise the offer, the analysts said that remained
a distinct possibility.
    Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch/Shell
Group's <RD> <SC> bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil
Co in 1984 and 1985. Royal Dutch/Shell eventually raised its
initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share, after
lawsuits by minority shareholders.
    ""I think they're going to have to go a little higher
eventually, just as Royal Dutch/Shell had to go a little higher
for the Shell Oil minority shares,"" Bruce Lazier of Prescott
Ball and Turben said. He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share.
    Royal Dutch/Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30.5 pct
of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984. After
objections from minority shareholders about the price, Royal
Dutch/Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender
offer in April 1984.
    But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the
offer. After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil,
Royal Dutch/Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase.
    It ended up paying 5.67 billion dlrs for the outstanding
Shell Oil stake, a significant premium to its original bid of
about 5.2 billion dlrs.
    The analysts made their comments before Simon's remarks at
a BP press conference in New York this afternoon.
    Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told
clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible. The
analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share.
    Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the
Royal Dutch/Shell group precedent. But there may be shareholder
lawsuits for the same reason, they said.

addition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988
through fiscal 1990.

waste business through GSX Corp.

potential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right

maybe not tomorrow or the next day, but some time later in the

ICCO member cocoa, comprise a representative basket of various
grade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades,
delegates said.
    Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be
able to buy non-member cocoa also, and pay a single price for
the buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin.

depleted capital levels, will be broadened to apply to all

    Finally, it will eliminate a current requirement that a
bank have capital of at least four pct to participate in the

first-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed
1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual.
    Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln
dlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the
Brazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in
lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.
    A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs
from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was
mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in
consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.
    Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,
Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or
4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not
resumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for the
whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.
    Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on
non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended
interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest
income by 1.5 mln dlrs.
    Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs
from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from
3.96 pct.
    This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a
reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation
of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and
a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's
cost of funds.

repurchase program announced by General Motors Corp is in part
an attempt to placate shareholders angry over the recent
repurchase of shares from Texan H. Ross Perot last year.
    ""He (Perot) was obviously the big trigger"" said analyst
Joseph Phillippi of E.F. Hutton Co. ""There was a firestorm of
criticism from people on the institutional side.""
    Wall Street analysts said the GM buyback will boost the
shares in the near term but some had reservations about the
long term effects of the plan.
    ""They're trying to soothe irate shareholders irriated by
the buyout of Ross Perot,"" said analyst David Healy of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
    Healy said General Motors chairman Roger Smith had been
hinting at a buyback program in meetings with institutional
investors. He said the plan, which could cost more than five
billion dlrs over four years, was similar in size to Ford Motor
Co's <F> repurchase program but smaller on a percentage basis
than that of Chrysler Corp <C>.
    Healy said General Motors will have to borrow money to buy
back stock on a large scale.
    The General Motors plan, announced after a board of
directors meeting in New York, calls for repurchase of up to 20
pct of the common stock by the end of 1990.
    The GM board also authorized repurchase of up to five mln
class E <GME> and class H <GMH> shares. GM shares closed at
75-5/8, up 7/8, in composite trading prior to the company's
announcement. However subsequently Jefferies and Co, which
trades NYSE-listed issues outside regular hours, said it was
making a market in the shares at 77-1/2 to 78.
    ""The stock is obviously going to be strong tomorrow,"" said
Ronald Glantz, analyst at Montgomery Securities.
    ""I don't know where the money (for the buyback) is coming
from unless they borrow,"" Glantz said. ""Their credit rating is
going to fall."" GM said it anticipates a decrease in automotive
capital spending.
    Glantz believes GM could be inviting a strike this fall by
going ahead with the buyback program at a time when it has
37,000 employees on indefinite layoff and 11 plants marked for
closing. After deciding against a profit sharing bonus for
workers and buying out Perot for 743 mln dlrs ""this will be
seen as rubbing salt into the wound,"" Glantz said. ""GM must be
challenging the union to make it the strike target.""
    Glantz said he is not changing his buy recommendation on GM
and expects the shares to rise. But he said he did not think
the overall plan was ""prudent.""
    ""Obviously we're going to get at least an opening gap in
the stock tomorrow,"" Hutton's Phillippi said.
    He says GM apparently believes as a result of a cost
reduction program plus the falloff in capital spending levels
""they can handle a stock buyback of this magnitude within the
confines of their cash flow."" Phillippi, who has been telling
clients to hold GM shares mainly for income, said on balance
""we've got to feel they're doing something constructive.""

309,"Swiss lawyers have largely headed off an
attempt to restrict banking secrecy and curb their powers to
act for clients despite the new, revised code of banking
conduct agreed by the Bankers' Association this week, analysts
said.
    The ""laundering"" of drug and ""insider dealing"" money and
controversy over accounts of the ousted Philippine and Haitian
Presidents have hurt the standing of Swiss banks recently and
strained international relations, particularly with the United
States.
    Critics said the new code fell well short of demands for
reform, doing little to close a key loophole in the requirement
that banks know the identity of their customers.
    The Social Democratic party, a member of the ruling
four-party coalition, which forced an unsuccesful 1984
referendum to curb banking secrecy, complained the code still
fell short of the legal controls they wanted.
    ""It looks a slight improvement on paper, but the same tricks
will still be possible in practice,"" Felix Meier, a senior party
official, told Reuters.
    In contrast, Swiss lawyers are happy with the new code.
    ""Apart from a few nuances, we are very pleased with the
agreement,"" said Max Oesch, a senior official of the Swiss
Lawyers Federation, which has fought a long campaign to prevent
any curbs on lawyers' ability to act for their clients.
    ""It has shown that the 4,000 Swiss lawyers who do a good job
should not be punished for the sake of getting at the one or
two black sheep.""
    The role of lawyers has been at the centre of long running
discussions on the renewal of the so-called ""convention of
diligence,"" a voluntary code of banking conduct introduced in
response to a major banking scandal here in 1977.
    With secrecy back in the public eye due to the Ferdinand
Marcos case and a Swiss bank link to the recently busted ""Pizza
Connection"" international heroin ring, officials at the Banking
Commission said earlier this year they wanted a tightening of
rules on anonymity.
    However, the changes in the new code, which comes into
operation in October, have been minor.
    Clients will still be able to keep their identity secret
from the banks provided their lawyer pledges that the
relationship with his client ""is not only of a temporary nature""
and involves provision of other legal services.
    The Lawyers' Association said this part of their business
is very minimal anyway. In the majority of cases, people had
perfectly legal private or commercial reasons for not wanting
the bank to know their identity, Oesch said.
    The Banking Commission, despite its earlier demand for a
virtual abolition of the loophole, also said it was happy with
the new code.
    However, critics complain that the agreement does not go
far enough to restrict the role of lawyers and could still be
circumvented by criminals.
    ""No other group in society is allowed to regulate itself as
much as the banks,"" complained Meier of the Social Democrats. ""I
hope that the Banking Commission exercises its proper control
function.""
    However, other parts of the agreement won praise.
    In particular, banks will also now be required to demand
the identity anyone doing more than 100,000 Swiss francs worth
of business with them, even if they do not have an account at
the bank. Until now, the threshold was 500,000 francs.
    Peter Kluser, head of the National Bank's legal department,
which had argued for a lower limit, said the move could help
combat the use of banks to ""launder"" or hide the criminal origin
of money.
    The new code also clarifies the legal status of a tribunal
able to impose heavy fines on banks which do not respect the
code.

310,"A government-appointed special
prosecutor has ordered the filing of corruption charges over
the closure of a private bank against Philippine central bank
governor Jose Fernandez, who said he would contest the charges.
    Ombudsman Raul Gonzalez told Reuters there was evidence to
indicate that Fernandez had misused his office in ordering the
closure of <Pacific Banking Corp> in July, 1985.
    He said the charges against Fernandez would be filed ""within
the week"" in a special court for corruption cases, adding that a
defendant could appeal against a ruling in the Supreme Court.
    Fernandez is in New York for talks with the Philippines'
creditor banks on rescheduling about 9.4 billion dlrs of the
country's foreign debt.
    A central bank statement quoted Fernandez as saying Pacific
Bank's closure and sale were in accordance with law.
    ""Fernandez said that some points may have been missed in the
appreciation of the case for which reason he will be filing a
motion for reconsideration of the (Ombudsman's) resolution,"" the
statement said.
    Central bank sources said the statement was drafted after
Fernandez and senior deputy governor Gabriel Singson, who is in
Manila, conferred on the telephone.
    Gonzalez said his office ordered the charges filed after
hearing submissions by Fernandez and plaintiff Paula Paug, the
president of Pacific Bank's Employees Union.
    In her complaint, Paug said Fernandez had acted arbitrarily
in ordering the closure of Pacific Bank and placing it under
receivership without giving the bank the right to appeal,
throwing hundreds of employees out of work.
    Paug also said Fernandez had not withdrawn his stockholding
in Far East Bank and Trust Company, which took over Pacific
Bank's assets, when he became central bank governor in January,
1984. Fernandez founded Far East in 1960.
    She alleged Fernandez had misused his position by
appointing two Far East bank executives to central bank
consultancies, giving them access to Pacific Bank records. She
also disputed Fernandez' interpretation of Pacific's accounts
from January 1980 to May 1985, claiming the bank had made a
profit, not a loss.
    The central bank statement quoted Fernandez as stressing
that Pacific Bank was ""repeatedly given notice of the continuing
losses of the bank and the immediate need of putting up
additional capital to eliminate insolvency.""
    It said the central bank tried to assist in a bid by Bank
of Hawaii and Philippine sugar trader Antonio Chan to purchase
Pacific Bank, but the negotiations collapsed ""because of certain
legal impediments.""
    The statement said the central bank invited several banks
to submit offers for Pacific, and the sale to Far East was
approved by the Monetary Board and not by Fernandez alone.
    Fernandez was also quoted in the statement as saying he had
divested himself of all interests in Far East Bank when he
became central bank governor. A Far East Bank spokesman
declined comment on the charges against Fernandez.
    In a footnote to a 12-page resolution recommending
prosecution against Fernandez, Gonzalez said prima facie
evidence of misuse of power also existed against all the then
members of the country's Monetary Board, as well as the Far
East executives, and ordered their investigation.
    He said Fernandez's action fitted in with the political
climate during former President Ferdinand Marcos's final years.
    ""(The) prevailing mood of the day for those in high offices
was either to imitate the penchant of then President Marcos and
his wife, to run roughshod over the human rights of citizens
... Or to follow blindly or with canine devotion any
instructions from above,"" Gonzalez wrote.
    Gonzalez, named to his post 11 months ago, said his office
had received more than 4,000 complaints of misuse of power. He
said among those facing prosecution were five provincial
governors appointed by President Corazon Aquino.

    De la Dehesa said the March rise, announced today by the

but acceptable.
    The year on year rate at the end of February was six pct.
Prices rose 8.3 pct last year.

error in last January's consumer price index. Economists had
earlier said the error could have been as high as 0.2 pct.
    De la Dehesa said seasonal increases in food prices pushed
the index up in March and he expected the rate to be lower in
April.
    The Communist-led Workers Commissions union said the March
price rise showed inflation was going up again and the
government looked increasingly unlikely to meet its five pct
target.
    The Workers Commissions said the inflation trend fuelled
unions's claims to wage increases beyond the government's
recomendation to limit wage rises at around five pct.
    Spain is being affected by a two-month-old wave of strikes
for wage rises. Government officials note wage settlements so
far this year have yielded average increases upwards of six
pct, while unions say the figure is higher then seven pct.

Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning
Organisation said.
    He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of
economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985,
which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.
    Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a
drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury
wholesale index last year.
    This year's target of 20 pct ""might be attainable but the
economic management will have to be careful,"" he said.
    Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme
which is central to the government's economic planning, said
Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account
shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.
    ""We must alleviate the current account substantially to
sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure
over the last five years,"" he added.
    His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said
Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms
would look better if inflation were lower and the current
account deficit cut or turned into a surplus.
    ""In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector
investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a
percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible
improvement in the current account deficit,"" he said.
    Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was
also to blame for the high deficits.
    Appropriations to government departments had been cut by
eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign
borrowing by municipalities had been restrained.
    ""We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the
investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations,"" he
said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing
requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated
5.6 pct in 1986.
    More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also
targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage
exports, and production incentives were being considered.
    ""We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected
into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion
policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and
local private capital come more into play as far as
manufacturing capacity is concerned,"" Tigrel said.
    He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish
economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under
way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate
policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done
in a country where the state still dominates industry and the
currency is only partially convertible.

unscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last night
that packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather experts
said.
    ""There might have been some isolated storms, but certainly
nothing damaging,"" said Charles Stichler, an extension
agronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far West
Texas.
    Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the New
York cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.
   Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95
cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25
cents.
    ""What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, and
when that happens, everybody sees it,"" said Dale Mohler, a
senior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc.
    Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, which
produces about 80 pct of that state's crop.
    The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. ""That's hurricane
force. But they were isolated to just a small portion of the
West Texas area, probably less than five pct,"" Mohler said.
    ""No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in July
or August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have been
worse,"" Mohler said.
    About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has been
planted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend if
weather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.
    The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about
95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavier

    The Transport Ministry estimates new orders at 3.3 mln CGRT

338,"The new International Natural Rubber
Agreement (INRA), like the 1979 pact, will use a buffer stock
as the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding
export quotas or production controls.
    The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under
the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD).
    In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble
those contained in the present one.
    The reference price, currently 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore
cts per kilo, will be maintained -- unless between now and
October 22, when the 1979 INRA expires, the average of the
daily market indicator price remains above the upper
intervention (""may sell"") price (231 cts) or below the lower
intervention (""may buy"") price (171 cts) for six months.
    If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely
considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts
-- the price would be revised under the current accord by five
pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber
Council decides.
    The new reference price would then be taken over for the
new agreement.
    Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference
price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the
Council decides on a higher percentage.
    Similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to
300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, the
reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless
the Council decides on a higher percentage.
    Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price
reviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18.
    Those changes are intended to make the reference price more
responsive to market trends.
    As in the present accord the ""may buy"" and ""may sell"" levels
are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the
""must buy"" and ""must sell"" levels at 20 pct of it.
    The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceiling
prices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless the
Council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months.
    During the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposal
that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock,
currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes.
    The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the
same as under the present one -- 400,000 tonnes, with provision
for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes.
    Under the new accord, the contingency buffer stock will be
brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price.
    At last Friday's session, Ahmed Farouk, speaking for
producers, said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact
had served the purpose for which it had been created.
    Gerard Guillonneau of France, who spoke for consumers,
agreed that the current agreement had worked ""relatively well.""
    Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA,
delegates noted that for nearly its whole life, the 1979 accord
had maintained the average price above the ""must buy"" level.
    They said the agreement until now did not appear to have
encouraged excessive production of rubber.
    In addition, provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer
stock have now been eliminated, ruling out speculation. ""It is a
sort of middle-of-the-road agreement,"" one delegate said.
    The new pact will be open for signature at U.N.
Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year.
    To become operational, it will require ratification by
countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of
world imports.
    Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from
now. During the hiatus between the two agreements, the
International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place.
    The pact will enter into force definitively when
governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct
of world imports have ratified it.

347,"Sudan has rejected a demand by the
International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because
such a move would have a negative impact on its economy, the
official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported.
    Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said his
government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies
on basic consumer goods.
    SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation,
said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum
yesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan.
    Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, is
some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared it
ineligible for fresh loans in February last year.
    In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of
its pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchange
rate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency.
    Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditors
for more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluations
had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices.
Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar
for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers.
    Dealers in Khartoum's thriving black market said the dollar
was sold at 5.5 pounds today.
    With stringent import regulations and the government
increasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollars
are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring
countries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire.
    Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF
and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal
talks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan's
economic performance.
    The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economic
recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious
attempt to tackle the country's economic troubles and persuade
its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears.
    This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill of
health from the IMF that it could take to Western government
creditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, to
reschedule debt payments.
    Twenty-three pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is owed to
members of the Paris Club, the diplomats said.
    Sudan's Finance Minister said last month the country's IMF
representative had told him the fund's executive board was ""very
pleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past
couple of months.""
    The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing Director
Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudan
owes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more.
    Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs
but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the
fiscal year ending next June 30.

AG <INSZ.Z> is raising 200 mln marks through an equity warrant
eurobond package with a two pct coupon priced at par, lead
manager Schweizerische Bankverein (Deutschland) AG said.
    The five-year bond, for Inspectorate International Finance
NV, gives investors options on two separate warrant series ""A""
and ""B"" exercisable into participation certificates in parent and
guarantor Inspectorate International AG.
    The first ""A"" series carries warrants for four participation
certificates. Upon exercising the ""A"" warrants, investors also
get two warrants for the ""B"" series.
    The ""A"" exercise period runs from May 7, 1987, to August 6,
1987. The exercise price is 543 Swiss francs.
    Of the two ""B"" warrants, one entitles investors to purchase
one participation certificate in Inspectorate International AG
and the other provides seven warrants.
    Investors may pay for ""B"" participation certificates by
redeeming the bond issued today. In this case, the bond, issued
in denominations of 5,000 marks, will be valued at a fixed
price of 4,200 Swiss francs, or 119.05 francs per 100 marks.
    Participation certificates acquired with ""B"" warrants will be
priced at 597 francs, equalling the price of the first tranche,
plus a 10 pct premium. The exercise period for the ""B"" series is
from August 8, 1987 to May 5, 1991.
    Fees for the bond total 2-1/4 pct, with 1-1/2 points for
selling, and 1-3/4 for management and underwriting combined.
    Investors will pay for the bond on April 8, and the bond
pays annual interest on the same day. It matures on April 8,
1992. The bond and warrants will be listed in Frankfurt.
    If all participation share warrants are exercised, the
company will obtain some 300 mln marks in new equity.
    The construction allows Inspectorate to borrow at lower
cost than a comparable convertible bond and will give the
Inspectorate equity through issues of participation
certificates in West Germany, a Swiss Bank Corp spokesman said.
    Inspectorate requires funding to finance its purchase of a
51 pct stake in Harpener AG, a diversified West German group,

    The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada
Inc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line

    The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials
availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the

    The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant
producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer
that can replace tetra ethyl lead.
    Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States

357,"Bolivia's proposal to repurchase at a
deep discount the 900 mln dlrs it owes to foreign commercial
banks is likely to be accepted, bolivian central bank governor
Javier Nogales Iturri said.
    Speaking to reporters at the annual meeting of the Inter-
American Development Bank, Nogales said Bolivia's bank advisory
committee, led by Bank of America, is seeking permission from
creditor banks worldwide to go ahead with the scheme.
    More than 50 pct of the banks must approve, and Nogales
said he is confident this threshold will be reached.
    ""It's working out very well, and I think we'll get a clear
majority,"" Nogales said.
    A senior banker working on the deal also said that banks
are responding positively and said all the legal waivers
necessary could be obtained within two months.
    Bolivia halted all payments on its commercial bank debt in
March 1984. Hyperinfltion has been curbed and public spending
trimmed, but the country's debt still trades as low as 10 cts
on the dollar on the secondary market, and many banks have
written off most, if not all, of their loans to the country.
    Few bankers see little chance for a subtantive recovery in
Bolivia's economic fortunes and so are willing to collect what
they can on the loans.
    Nogales said Bolivia would offer to buy back the debt at a
market price. He said some banks might want to hold out for a
higher price, but others would see the repurchase offer as an
opportunity to cut their losses.
    Bolivia intends to pay for the repurchase with aid that
foreign goernments, especially the United States and West
Germany, are providing to help finance the eradication of coca
crops. Cocaine, although illegal, is Bolivia's largest export.
    The campaign to persuade farmers to grow legal crops
instead of coca would be financed instead using local currency,
Nogales said.
    Because the fiscal deficit has been reduced to some four
pct of gross domestic product, money supply could be increased
to pay for the drug-eradication drive without too much of n
impact on inflation, he added.
    Nogales said he does not expect Bolivia's debt repurchase
to become a model for other debtors in dire straits. ""We're not
seeking a universal solution,"" he said.""

global economy. He added that the underlying fundamentals of
the U.S. economy are still strong, and that corporate earnings
also continue to be firm.

of a confluence of factors, including the globalization of
markets and the proliferation of new securities instruments.
    Those two factors alone have made the market more volatile,
he said.
    Phelan also said a major factor in the decline was the fact
that there has been no major correction in the five-year bull

386,"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone,
beleaguered by political turmoil at home, sets out Wednesday on
a tough mission to Washington aimed at defusing the most
serious U.S.-Japanese trade tension in recent memory.
    Two rounds of talks between President Reagan and Nakasone,
scheduled for Thursday and Friday, come on the heels of the
imposition by the United States of punitive tariffs on Japanese
goods for the first time since World War Two.
    In the past, bilateral trade friction involving cotton
goods, steel, television sets, textiles and cars have ended
with Japan taking on voluntary export curbs.
    Nakasone's visit could coincide with the passage of a
protectionist trade bill by the U.S. House of Representatives.
    A proposed amendment to the bill, drafted by Representative
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, will mandate a 10 pct annual
reduction in the trade surpluses of Japan and other nations
which have large trade gaps with the United States.
    The United States last year had a record trade deficit of
169.8 billion dlrs and Japan accounted for about one-third.
    Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda said recently
he was reasonably optimistic about the results of talks between
the two leaders.
    Top U.S. and Japanese officials have shuttled back and
forth across the Pacific to lay the groundwork for Nakasone's
visit. The last of the talks leading up to the main event will
be in Washington next Wednesday between U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz and Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari.
    Nakasone will have an economic package worked out by the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and by an advisory body
led by former Bank of Japan Governor Haruo Maekawa.
    Japan plans to spend over 5,000 billion yen to boost
domestic demand, increase imports of U.S. products including
supercomputers and give more help to developing countries,
government officials said.
    The government has been making last ditch efforts in time
for Nakasone's trip to address outstanding bilateral issues,
officials said.
    The issues include foreign access to a new Japanese
overseas telecommunications venture and a six billion dlr
international airport project in western Japan.
    Nakasone and his party last week reached a compromise
accord with opposition parties over a controversial sales tax
plan in exchange for parliamentary passage by the Lower House
of a government draft budget for 1987/88.
    The accord, offered by House Speaker Kenzaburo Hara,
virtually killed the Nakasone-sponsored plan, but left room for
future tax reform plans, political analysts said.
    Nakasone, who led his party to a resounding electoral
triumph last July, saw his popularity drop because of the sales
tax.
    His party suffered setbacks in an Upper House by-election
and nationwide local elections in the past two months.
    Mitsuru Uchida, professor of political science at Waseda
University, told Reuters: ""I doubt that whatever Nakasone does
in Washington -- no matter how good it might be -- would help
restore his weakened power-base at home.""

Venice summit of industrialized nations in June.

391,"A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
Petroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd <TRP.TO>
may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
    Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
substantial payments to creditors will expire.
    Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
    Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
negotiations.
    TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt
restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
Ltd said from Toronto.
    Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
    ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""
said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
Calgary.
    TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
refinancing packages, Gobert said.
    The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
to agree to a restructuring, he added.
    ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.
    Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to
us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
reluctant to come forward,"" he said.
    Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
    Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
TransCanada's.
    Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
    However, he said not enough financial details are known
about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
TransCanada's proposed offer.

from today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of local
and foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached at
the end of May.
    The central bank's statement added that the measure would
be effective until the end of July.
    Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of
foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. They
added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge
of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend
foreign exchange to importers and exporters.
    Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks
reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,
according to official statistics.
    Last week the central bank said that from today it would
reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40
pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move
was needed because of ""distortions"" in the foreign exchange
market.
    Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,
have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank
market to avoid exchange rate losses.
    Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May
reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9
billion in April.
    All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted
into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming
exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in
the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.
    In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on
remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to
Taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.
    Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of
the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of
speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has
flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S..
    Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about
22 pct against the U.S. Dollar.
    Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the
foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on
capital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will
be dropped by the end of July or early August.
    Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement caused
jitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy
purchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank sold

428,"The supercomputer industry is getting
crowded as a handful of startup companies and some huge
Japanese manufacturers compete for the right to apply the label
""world's fastest machine"" to their products.
    Currently there are only about 250 supercomputers installed
around the world, but many believe that situation is about to
change dramatically as these highly specialized and extremely
expensive machines move out of the research laboratories where
most of them are found today and into commerical applications.
    ""It is commercial supercomputing... that holds the most
promise for this young industry's handful of vendors,"" said
Gary Smaby, supercomputer analyst for Piper Jaffray and
Hopwood.
    These commercial applications, he said, could propel annual
sales of supercomputers from 850 mln dlrs in 1986 to 2.4
billion by 1990.
    For years two companies, Cray Research Inc <CYR> and
Control Data Corp  <CDA> were virtually the only options for
customers seeking to buy supercomputers.
    But in the last three years a number of new companies have
announced supercomputers using some innovative technologies,
and the industry finally expanded enough to hold its first
World Supercomputer Exhibition in Santa Clara last month.
    Also in the last month two small companies, ETA Systems Inc
(a subsidiary of Control Data) and Thinking Machines Corp  both
laid claim to having the world's fastest computer and a joint
venture of Honeywell Inc <HON> and Japan's NEC Corp <NIPN.T>
Honeywell-NEC Supercomputers Inc, announced its entrance into
the U.S. market.
    All three are aiming at industry leader Cray Research Inc,
which holds more than 60 pct of the market.
    This week, Cray plans to make a joint announcement with
Digital Equipment Corp, <DEC> already the world's largest
minicomputer maker, of some products that will work on both
companies' computers, expanding the market opportunities for
both supers and minis even further.
    Supercomputers were initially designed only for the most
complex of applications, such as predicting worldwide weather
patterns, fusion energy research or military defense and
weapons design.
    They are built for speed, not for standard business
functions such as payroll processing. The fastest
supercomputers can perform more than a billion calculations per
second, greater than the combined power of 100,000 personal
computers.
    They also carry stratospheric price tags of between one mln
to 20 mln dlrs each, which is why Cray's revenues could reach
600 mln dlrs last year even though it only shipped 36 new and
10 used supercomputers, a level that would spell starvation for
any standard computer company.        
    But speakers at the supercomputer exhibition emphasized
that a host of new applications should increase total industry
shipments to 150 systems a year by the end of the decade.
    Most commercial customers of supercomputers now use the
machines to simulate a physical process, such as the flow of
air over an aircraft wing, in design and testing work.
    But financial institutions, particularly Wall Street
brokerage houses, are considered the next major buyers of
supercomputers as they try to recognize changes in stock
trading patterns faster than any of their competitors.
    Two firms, Goldman Sachs and Co and Morgan Stanley and Co,
are now using superminicomputers, hybrid machines that are
faster than a minicomputer but cheaper than a super, to create
financial models of the stock and bond markets.
    Analysts said it is only a matter of time before actual
supercomputers are found on Wall Street.
    One reason for the shift to commercial applications is that
supercomputers are coming down in price as new technologies
provide greater speed at lower costs than the Cray and Control
Data behemoths.
    Both the ETA and Thinking Machines Systems use a technology
called parallel processing, in which a number of internal
processors work together to solve a problem.
    With such systems a problem is broken up and different
segments are assigned to different processors. By contrast,
standard computers solve a problem one instruction at a time,
or sequentially.
    The ETA system, the ETA 10, will eventually use as many as
eight parallel processors capable of processing up to 8.32
billion operations per second.
    However, the first ETA 10, installed at Florida State
University, has only two processors, later to be expanded to
four.  ETA president Lloyd Thorndyke said the ETA 10 represents
a drastic change in architecture from parent company Control
Data's Cyber system.
    Priced from 5.5 mln to 22 mln dlrs, the ETA 10 contains
about 240 chips in each of its processing units, built onto a
board about the size of a standard newspaper section.
    Each of these boards contains the equivalent of 1.5 miles
of embedded wiring.
    It took ETA about 3-1/2 years to develop its supercomputer
but Thorndyke said he expects much faster development time
frames in the futre, from both ETA and its competitors.
    ""We're in a leapfrog business and we just took the last
leap,"" he said.
    Thinking Machines also claims to have the world's fastest
computer and in some ways this is true. Its Connection Machine
Model CM-2 can process 2.5 billion instructions per second, but
it is a very specialized architecture only meant for certain
very specific applications.
    The one mln to five mln dlr Connection Machine uses a
technology called ""massive parallism."" It contains 64,000
processors crammed into a five foot cube. The processors all
work on a problem at once, breaking it down into minute bits.
    It is an ideal tool for applications with many
unpredicatble variables, according to Brian Boyle, analyst for
Novon Research Group. ""The more unpredictable things are, the
more the Thinking Machine will be appropriate,"" he said.

431,"The Finance Ministry is putting the
finishing touches on a roughly 2,000 billion yen supplementary
budget for 1987/88 and has started to turn its attention to
next year's main budget, ministry officials said.
    The supplementary budget is designed to help finance the
6,000 billion yen emergency economic package the government
unveiled last month to boost domestic demand.
    Ministry officials said the government would issue about
1,300 billion yen in construction bonds to help pay for the
increased public investment set out in the emergency package.
    The rest of the supplementary budget will be financed by
450 billion yen in proceeds from last year's sale of shares in
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) and by higher than
expected 1986/87 tax revenues, officials said.
    One official said the carry-over of tax revenues into the
1987/88 fiscal year that began on April 1 might be more than
1,000 billion yen. Soaring land and share prices have boosted
receipts, especially from securities and land taxes.
    With less than half of the carry-over likely to be used in
the current supplementary budget, the rest will be available
for a second supplementary budget expected later this year.
    The second supplementary budget will be used to finance the
government's wage bill, which will not be known until after
wage talks later this year, one official said.
    The government must also finance the tax cut of more than
1,000 billion yen which it promised in its emergency package
but which will not be contained in the first supplementary
budget, due to be presented to parliament next month.
    The Finance Ministry's budget bureau is hoping the tax
carry-over and higher than expected revenues again this year
will be enough to finance the second supplementary budget, he
said.
    Officials said the Finance Ministry does not want to issue
deficit-financing bonds or use the extra proceeds from this
year's NTT share sale to fund the second supplementary budget.
    Besides the first supplementary budget, the government also
intends to introduce a new tax reform bill to parliament during
the upcoming extraordinary session, officials said.
    The government was forced to abandon its first tax reform
bill due to strong opposition to its plan to introduce a five
pct sales tax.
    The sales tax was designed to help finance cuts in
individual and corporate income taxes.
    The new bill will present the 1,000 billion yen-plus tax
cut contained in the emergency package as the first step to an
overhaul of the country's tax system, officials said.
    It will also contain a controversial plan to phase out tax
breaks on savings, although it may not take effect in October
as originally planned, they said.
    Looking ahead to next year's main budget, the Finance
Ministry is beginning to debate whether to abandon its
so-called minus ceiling for public investment.
    That policy calls on government departments to cut public
investment spending by five pct per year.
    Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo said recently the
policy would be suspended in 1988/89, pending a recommendation
from the government's administrative reform council.
    The ruling Liberal Democratic Party said in April that
budget request guidelines for invesment expenditures would be
reviewed.
    But some officials at the Finance Ministry's budget bureau
said they were hopeful the policy would be retained.
    They fear that a suspension of the guidelines for public
investment could lead to increased pressure on the government
to loosen its grip on current expenditures as well.
    The account would also extend interest-free loans to
profitable public works projects developed in conjunction with
the private sector, the officials said.
    In this way, the Finance Ministry could meet growing
pressure on it to boost capital spending while maintaining a
tight grip on outlays by other government departments.
    Surplus funds from this year's sale of NTT shares could
total about 3,000 billion yen. Based on the current market
price, the planned sale of 1.95 mln shares would raise more
than 5,000 billion yen, compared to about 2,000 billion planned
for in the main 1987/88 budget.

impending recession. If that is the case the Republicans will
have a very difficult time winning,"" independent political
analyst William Schneider told Reuters. ""If the Democrats

    Schneider's comments, on the heels of a 500-point decline
in the bellwheter Dow Jones stock market average, reflected the
old political adage that elections are almost always decided by
voters' feelings about their financial well being.
    ""There is no doubt people always vote their pocketbook and
we don't expect 1988 to be any different,"" says Donald Foley,

Gephardt's Democratic presidential campaign.
    Foley added that the five-year old stock market rally has

    President Reagan said he was puzzled by the day's events,
but is convinced the economy is fundamentally sound.
    ""I think everyone is puzzled ... because all the business
indices are up. There is nothing wrong with the economy,"" he
told reporters.
    ""I don't think anyone should panic because all the economic
indicators are solid,"" he added.
    But for the time being, the decline on Wall Street knocked
the underpinnings from his boasts that the record bull market
demonstrates the wisdom of current economic policy.
    It could also deprive the Republicans of a major argument
for keeping the White House in their hands when President
Reagan leaves office in January 1989.
    It gives a hollow ring to the words used by Vice President
George Bush just a week ago when he formally entered the White
House race.
    ""We have weathered the storm. Our economy has recovered to
be the strongest in history,"" Bush said in reference to the
recovery from the 1981-82 recession that pushed unemployment to
its highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
    ""We mark next week the longest peacetime economic expansion
in our nation's recorded history,"" Bush bragged.
    At midday, even as Wall Street was being battered by a
record selling panic, Reagan gave a glowing account of the
economy's performance at a swearing in ceremony for his new
Commerce Secretary, William Verity.
    Indeed, the Labor Department reported earlier this month
that unemployment among American workers had fallen to an
eight-year low of 5.9 pct in September, compared to seven pct a
year ago and a Post World War Two peak of 10.7 pct in December
1982.
    But with interest rates climbing steadily and no
improvement in the record U.S. trade deficit with the rest of
the world, a number of economic experts have expressed doubts
about the staying power of the current expansion.
   Warnings of economic danger around the corner have been a
staple of Democratic campaign speeches this year.
    And Democratic party leaders here for an organizational
meeting two weeks ago predicted at that time that the economy
would be the determining factor in next year's election.
    ""The 1988 election will be decided, as most peacetime
elections are, on economic issues,"" said Michigan party chairman
Richard Weiner.
    ""In Ohio, people are uneasy. They want to know where the
economy is going,"" added Ohio Democratic leader James Ruvulo.
    American political history is replete with examples of
voters throwing out incumbent officeholders when the economy
turns sour -- most notably in 1932 when Democrat Franklin
Roosevelt won a landslide triumph that ended 12 years of
Republican rule and made the Democrats the nation's majority
party for more than 40 years.
    But political experts said that if Monday's stock decline
turns out to be a temporary phenomena it will have no effect on
the 1988 election.

added, ""Never make predictions, especially about the future.""

    Its British Sugar Corp Plc unit produced its best ever
performance due to greater efficiency and better selling prices
and was on course for record full year profits.
    In the last year Berisford attempted to sell the unit and
attracted several bids. A bid by Hillsdown Holdings Plc

officially blocked and a sale of BSC to <Gruppo Ferruzzi> also

    Berisford said it was particularly pleased with the
progress of its associate Hunter Saphir Plc, in which it
acquired a substantial equity stake in January in return for

    Since the deal was completed, the market value of the stake

ingredients -- mainly sugar, gelatine and flavours.
    The property division maintained good growth while
financial services made a satisfactory contribution to profits.
However, the results of the industrial division continued to be

presented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan
for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be
forced reluctantly to accept.
    Under the plan steel output would remain subject to
restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for
years to come while steel firms undertook a massive
slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand.
    Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the
ending of the quota system by December 1988.
    He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC
law is supposed to exist except in times of ""manifest crisis.""
    But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this
idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in
their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to
alternative products and accounts firmly in the red.
    Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are
likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the
industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the
political impact of plant closures, they said.
    Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the
EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota
production system at least until the end of 1990.
    Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it
identified scope for closing plants on a ""voluntary"" basis to
reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year.
    Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that
of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed.
    Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the
Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program,
particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments.
    The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs this
decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes.

apparent escalation of Iranian rhetoric with continued
assurances that its expanded military force in the Gulf would
play purely a deterrent role.
    ""I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, that
we're going to be assuring safety for American shipping and
that that shipping is not related to the war itself,"" State
Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.
    He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States
was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran.
    Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday,
""At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of
an armed encounter with us.
    ""We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S.
Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. We
are determined to stand firm and will certainly win.""
    The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up its
Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the
refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the
strategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf.
    The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil
tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag
and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks.
    Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said, ""We won't have any comment or response to
the Iranian statements. Our position has been made clear about
the status of events in the Gulf. We want an end to the war
with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements
that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not
helpful or welcome.""

Iran has offered to halt attacks on Gulf shipping.

    ""Lower prices for crude oil and natural gas and reduced
margins in our oil and chemical products businesses were the
major factor for the earings decline,"" John F. Bookout,
president, said in a statement.
    For the quarter, the company, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell

it may be difficult to fully recover from the depressed margins

volumes and continued high industry operating rates.

dlrs last year, while natural gas prices dropped 24 pct, Shell

selling prices were only partially offset by reduced raw
material costs.
    The company said earnings from chemical products also fell
sharply, to 40 mln dlrs from 72 mln dlrs, due mainly to lower
margins, especially in commodity chemicals, coupled with its
pullout from the agricultural chemicals business in October

power of its army...,"" said the statement quoted by IRNA.

505,"Prospects for world economic growth remain
very sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is
urgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize
currencies and encourage investment, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.
    ""The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months,
and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments
imbalances are likely to persist,"" it said in one of its
gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.
    The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of
western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only
2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's
2.5 pct growth rate.
    ""We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area
comfortably exceeding three pct,"" David Henderson, head of the
OECD's economics and statistics department, said.
    The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising
inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.,
Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world
debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic
downturn.
    ""At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth
remain favorable,"" it said, citing low inflation in most major
countries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest
rates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible
labor markets.
    But private sector confidence had been undermined by
uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that ""for
confidence to be restored, it is important for governments
swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.""
    This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accord
of the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.
    The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major
countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to
undermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal
policies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand
in the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.
    Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced
recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works
and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this
process, though it was too early to estimate its precise
impact.
    He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domestic
demand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.
    The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has
worsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast
to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct
increase in 1986.
    There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the
unemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the
average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last
year.

agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from
price guarantees and other measures linked to production
towards direct income support for farmers.

government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988
after seven years of austerity, economists said.
    ""Our country is walking on one leg now,"" said Ismail Salleh,
an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International
Studies. ""It has to depend on public sector investment for
faster growth if the private sector is not moving.""
    Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking
one pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.
    The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under
two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct
because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.
Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and
semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.
    The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion
ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.
    Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct
in 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.
    Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen
blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.
    One businessman said too many politicians give the
impression that Malaysia was unstable.
    ""If we can take care of investment confidence, the potential
to recover strongly is great,"" a banker said.
    Malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in the
black with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit
surplus compared with last year's 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.
    The government has said its fiscal policies will balance
the budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.
    The government will also repay some of its external debt,
which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.
    Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt
ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential
goods are unlikely to change.
    Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the
corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to
compete for investors with neighbouring states.

514,"The dollar ended with modest net losses
against most major currencies as the market conducted a final
round of position-squaring ahead of tomorrow's crucial Group of
Five and Group of Seven meetings, dealers said.
    ""The dollar was trendless today. People are waiting to see
if anything new comes from the meetings tomorrow and will then
take it from there,"" said one dealer at a top European bank.
    As a result, generally supportive comments by Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa went largely unheeded.
    The dollar closed at 145.60/70 yen, down from 145.85/90.
    However, the dollar's yen closing level was comfortably
above its overseas low of just under 145 yen. Against the mark,
the dollar finished at 1.8270/80 marks after falling to 1.8180
in Europe and ending at 1.8260/70 here yesterday.
    In Congressional testimony this morning, Fed Chairman Paul
Volcker harped on his long-held fears about the potentially
catastrophic fallout from a sharp dollar decline.
    He also said the dollar's fall, thus far, should be ""large
enough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal
restraint in the U.S., to support widespread expectations of a
narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead.""
    The market impact of Volcker's comments was minimal. ""It
was the same old story. Volcker was just fulfilling his role as
a defender of the currency,"" said one trader.
    The market was similarly dismissive of Japanese Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's upbeat appraisal of his hour-long
conversation with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker this
afternoon.
    Miyazawa said that they both agreed on the need for
currency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the role
the U.S. has played in coordinated international efforts to
prop up the dollar since the late February Paris agreement.
    ""Miyazawa can talk until he's blue in the face. The only
person who will make a difference is Baker,"" said Alan Rose of
First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles.
    ""The key question for the currency market is whether the
(Reagan) administration will have a change of view to the
dollar. If not, the dollar is going lower,"" he added.
    The dollar's recent tumble to a 40-year low of 144.70 yen
was linked to the market's perception that Washington was
unhappy with the rate of adjustment of world trade imbalances
and that a continued orderly dollar decline was the least
disruptive way of accelerating the process.
    While most analysts do not expect any marked change of
attitude in Washington, they were reluctant to open any fresh
positions until later in the week.
    ""We are reserving judgement for the time being,"" said Doug
Madison of Commerzbank Ag.
    The tranquility of the dollar market spread to sterling
trading today. The pound ended unchanged against the dollar at
1.6175/85 and edged up to 2.957 marks from 2.955 yesterday.
    However, underlying sentiment remains positive after a U.K.
opinion poll gave the ruling Conservative party its highest
popularity rating since it was re-elected in 1983.
    ""Sterling still seems to be on the firm side,"" said one
dealer.
    The Canadian currency also retained a generally stronger
tone, rising to 1.3055/60 to its U.S. counterpart from
1.3080/85 yesterday.
    According to figures provided by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co,
the dollar's trade-weighted value at midday was 5.7 pct below

518,"International Business Machines Corp,
hit by a two-year earnings slump, should begin a come-back by
the end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988, analyst Rick
Martin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said.
    ""There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit not
until later this year,"" Martin said at a technology conference
sponsored by the investment firm.
    Martin said the coming rebound reflects new product
introductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drastic
improvement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending.
    IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs in
mid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at
149-1/2 dlrs.
    Analysts, computer industry executives, and the company
itself, have highlighted the external economic factors
hampering IBM's growth.
    But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding
the rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, and
pointed to Digital Equipment Corp <DEC> to support his view.
""By replacing the product line, earnings have soared,"" he said
of DEC's line of VAX computers.
    In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatible
mid-range product line. A new computer code-named ""Fort Knox""
was supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-range
systems, but the product never got off the ground, he said.
    Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into the
IBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects should
be unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. ""The major story will be a
rebound in its mid-range business.""
    He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13
pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growth
in mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988.
    High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are coming
to the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5
pct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year, growth will
drop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said.
    By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16
pct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martin
said. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of
51.3 billion dlrs.
    Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earnings
and stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product
introductions in the mid-range area.
    In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to
DEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies were
catering largely to existing customer bases, rather than
stealing market share from one another.

524,"The Australian Stock
 Exchange Ltd (ASX)
today took up the responsibility for administering a new
coordinated market made up of Australia's six former exchanges,
now operating as subsidiary trading floors.
    At the same time, rules prohibiting corporations and
non-stock-exchange members from holding more than 50 pct of
Australia's 101 brokerage firms were abolished, leaving brokers
exposed to greater deregulation.
    Industry sources said the moves will smooth the changeover
to screen-based trading and give the equities market one voice.
    Westpac Banking Corp <WSTP.S> was one of the first to take
advantage of the changes by announcing today it would double
its stake in the Sydney firm <Ord Minnett Ltd> to 100 pct.
    Brokers have been introduced to creeping deregulation over
the past three years after legislation passed in 1984 to end
restrictive trade practices forced the traditional partnerships
to open themselves at first to partial ownership by outside
institutions, and eventually to full ownership.
    The phase-in period has ended, and several major banks and
offshore financial institutions are investigating taking larger
stakes in Australian broking houses, industry sources said.
    Though deregulation was all but forced on brokers, most now
acknowledge that the influx of capital and contacts from
non-member shareholders has benefited the industry, they said.
    ""Deregulation has brought an infusion of additional capital
and a broader base of products,"" ASX chairman Ian Roach told
Reuters.
    Roach said fears that major bank shareholders would impose
a restrictive and conservative ""bank culture"" on the dynamic
sharebroking industry were unfounded.
    ""So far the banks have been mindful of the importance of
preserving the entrepreneurial aspect of sharebroking,"" he said.
    But some brokers said others are sceptical and expect that
the expiration of ""golden handcuff"" pacts, which tied partners to
their firms for a period after incorporation, could cause a
massive talent drain.
    Several leading brokers have already announced plans to
leave their firms and establish new private client businesses,
while others plan public floats.
    While bank shareholders have enjoyed dabbling in broking
during Australia's record two-and-a-half year bull run, they
could find themselves without the expertise they need during
more difficult times, some brokers said.
    Rene Rivkin, head of Sydney brokerage house <Rivkin James
Capel Ltd>, said many brokers will resist anything that
restricts their individuality and entrepreneurial spirit, and
this could leave new entrants into the business short-staffed.
    ""If I were a bank I'm not sure I would have gone into
broking.... What's going to happen when a lot of these golden
handcuffs come to an end?"" Rivkin said.
    ""Only then will the banks know what they've got,"" he said.
    Rivkin's firm is 50 pct owned by Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corp <HKBH.HK> unit <Wardley Australia Ltd> and plans a
public float of between 25 and 30 pct.
    ""My relationship with the Hong Kong bank is wonderful. They
leave me alone and give me all the support I need.... Maybe if
we weren't doing so well there wouldn't be that support, but
that hasn't happened,"" he said.
    Other firms might not be so lucky, he said, and they could
find it difficult to preserve their independence when the bull
market ends.
    In the last two years, the value of the Australian
sharemarket has leapt 118 pct with turnover value up 152 pct to
31.24 billion dlrs in the year to June 30, 1986.
    That growth put existing trading systems and clearing
houses under pressure, and unification of the six sovereign
exchanges should accelerate the development of screen-based
trading and a single clearing house, industry sources said.
    From July this year 30 leading stocks will be traded in a
pilot of the ASX's screen trading system which, depending on
its reception by brokers, is expected to replace trading floors
over the next four years, industry sources said.

    Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5
billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from
16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.
    Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's
weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price
falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.
    The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and
plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.
    Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering
business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had
underpinned machinery and component activities.
    An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the
trading and services sectors, affected the group's total order

member companies which comprise the core area of the group,
rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said.

end-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.
    Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by
three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.
    The steel market weakened increasingly over the year,
mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in
foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer
industries.
    The difficult market for sections and flats of quality
steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said.
But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless

    It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and
sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.
    Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to
the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman
budget deficit control act of 1985, it said.
    Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency
payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225
mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said.
    The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents
per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were
received by producers requesting advance payments.
    Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference
between an established target price and the higher of the basic
loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers
during the first five months of the marketing year --
September-January.
    National weighted average market prices for the first five
months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and
1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will
be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the
3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.
    Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents
per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per
bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan
rate.
    The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the
maximum permitted by law, the department said.
    Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another
1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average
market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing
year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the
department said.

557,"Top officials of leading industrial
nations appear deeply worried that financial markets have
ignored their efforts to coordinate policies, which they
believe they strengthened in talks last week.
    Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the
markets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely
disrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of the
policy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States,
Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way to
reassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a
statement, and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
underscored that by saying: ""I don't believe at all that the
Americans want a weaker dollar.""
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the
dollar's latest rapid descent ""involves the risk -- now already
a tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation,
leading to a renewed rise in interest rates.""
    But there were signs too, that while policymakers feared
the market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little they
could do until the economic picture changed, and currencies
settled into a stable pattern as a result.
    Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week's
semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higher
U.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapid
descent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.
    Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told
television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving
the dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.
    ""It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would
adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would
drive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not
(into) recession, into slower growth,"" he said.
    Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the
dollar, Balladur said: ""When a currency is maintained
artificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is
not healthy.""
    And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to
recession, he said.
    Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of
life, Balladur said, ""there may be adjustments of course in one
or other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.""
    But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he
might rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.
    U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it
understood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.
    ""The United States and the six major industrial countries
are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these
agreements,"" Baker told the meetings.
    Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which
wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further
decline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed to
stabilizing currencies at current levels.
    Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February
22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed
to reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight
protectionism.
    West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate
domestic demand and lead a global upturn.
    Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's
promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.
    The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major
action. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable
currencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at
the time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.
    The Paris accord said, ""currencies (are) within ranges
broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given
the policy commitments summarized in this statement.""
    Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially
against the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent
with the agreement. ""The ministers and governors reaffirmed the
view that around current levels their currencies are within
ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,"" last week's
statement read.
    Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were
focusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.
Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan
rather than prospective policy changes. European monetary
sources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meant
business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit.

564,"Hungary is to embark on a new series of
austerity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripled
last year after quadrupling in 1985.
    The target deficit in the 1987 budget approved by
Parliament last December was 43.8 billion forints.
    But Zoltan Boesze, chief of the Finance Ministry's budget
financing division, told Reuters the government now saw this as
too high and had decided ""quite severe"" measures were needed.
    ""All the organizations of economic management have been
charged with elaborating further (savings) measures,"" he said.
    Asked if these measures were being taken under pressure
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Boesze said: ""The
Fund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results,
and of course the Fund would support these efforts.""
    IMF teams spent several weeks in Budapest late last year.
    Boesze said preliminary figures showed that Hungary's state
budget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints last
year from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984.
    The economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forints
because of poor performance by state firms, which needed
subsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency.
    The exact extent and nature of savings are still under
discussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largest
budget item -- must definitely fall, Boesze said.
    Subsidies to state firms, including grants to maintain low
consumer prices, exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164
billion forints in 1986, up from 152.9 billion in 1985.
Parliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints.
    ""I think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up the
former situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies,""
Boesze said. ""The central administration must be hard. ... If we
are not hard then we will not be successful.""
    Boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserve
provisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and
800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities. ""I believe
these reserves should not be used at all,"" he said.
    Wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domestic
product, which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct.
    The authorities had already signalled a small fall in real
wages for 1987, but Boesze said firms will suffer severe tax
penalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct.
    This would mean a severe cut in living standards, as retail
price inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986.
    A four-month basic wage freeze expires on April 1.
    About 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and
33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices.
    Boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant
cuts in price subsidies, but that social considerations made
this difficult.
    But he added: ""I think ultimately we will be able to make
curtailments in subsidies in this area as well.""
    He said Hungary plans to introduce price reform at the
beginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and
value added tax. The IMF supports these aims.
    Hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last September in an
attempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms.
    Between 100,000 and 150,000 workers are expected to be
unemployed at least temporarily by 1990. Labour discipline is
being tightened and firms may fire workers more easily.
    Boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state
by firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to
shed labour. He gave no exact figures.
    Istvan Nagy, a senior Finance Ministry official responsible
for drafting the bankrupcy law, told Reuters last year he hoped
the law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct.
    After subsidies to state enterprises, the largest single
budget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approved
for 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion).
    Interest payments on international debt are set to rise to
more than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and seven
billion in 1986, Boesze said.
    Hungary's net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last year
to 7.7 billion dlrs, according to provisional figures, while
trade with Western countries plunged into a deficit of more
than 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion dlr surplus just two years
earlier.
    Boesze said last year's budget deficit was financed 90 pct
by credits from the National Bank, mostly from abroad, and 10
pct by the issue of domestic state bonds.
    Deputy Prime Minister Frigyes Berecz told Hungarian
economists in a speech this month that the country's economy
was in a ""very difficult"" situation, but not in crisis.
    There would have to be a turnround with tangible results
this year, however, and borrowing must be used more
effectively.

subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the
Agriculture Department, a State Department official said.
    ""Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy
last summer, and he's not going to the mat again. It's now
basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what
they want to do,"" the official said.
    If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the
Soviet Union, he said, ""Shultz will not wage a vigorous
campaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, but
he won't go to the President and voice his objections.""
    In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarks
yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat
Growers, the State Department said, ""Secretary Shultz expressed
his belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should be
competitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.
    The Agriculture Department is in the best position to
determine whether consideration should be given at this time to
extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement
Program.""
    Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the
Soviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to
Moscow, the State Department official said.
    ""Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a
subsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had a
firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy.""
    USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the
USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized
wheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.
    The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds
that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring
U.S. prices down to competitive levels.
    The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, the
State Department source said.
    ""What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the
lowest price being paid by anyone in the world,"" he said.
    The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the
U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.
    Government and commodity sources also said there are
elements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary Daniel
Amstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.
    ""Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a
foregone conclusion,"" the State Department official said.

obscuring the fact that starvation is now a bigger problem than
ever before, a senior World Food Council official said.
    Alain Vidal Naquet, head of external relations for the
council, told a news conference that a meeting organised by the
United Nations body in Peking next week would try to force
governments to take a more serious attitude to the food crisis.
    ""The world is facing two crises -- poverty in developing
countries and paradoxically an overflow of food surpluses in
the northern part of the world,"" Naquet said.
    ""This is affecting dangerously the balance of the
international economy,"" Naquet said.
    He said it was ironic that the leaders of the western world
would discuss food over-production during the summit in Venice
next week at the same time as the Peking meeting would be
discussing food shortages.
    ""Hunger is not a problem kept in mind by governments. The
urgency of the problem is hidden by the (food surplus and
trade) problems of the rich countries,"" he said. ""There are more
people today in the world lacking enough food than there were
in 1974 (the year of the World Food Conference in Rome).""
     Progress has been made in some parts of the world,
especially Asia, but Naquet said that increasing food
production and aid from the developed world were not in
themselves the answer to the world food problem.
    He said developing countries should not rely entirely on
aid from developed countries and should increase cooperation
amongst themselves to increase local food production and
improve distribution of existing food stocks.

with its European Community partners as evidence emerged that
it could be much worse off as a result of new proposals to
radically alter the way the EC is financed.
    Analysis by officials and diplomats of proposals released
yesterday by the EC's executive Commission showed their full
impact, were they in force this year, would have left Britain
worse off by 545 mln European Currency Units.
    The proposals have to be agreed unanimously by member
government after a debate expected to open next month.
    The Commission said they were necessary to prevent the EC
from sliding once again into bankruptcy, and has described the
current financing system as unfair and unacceptable.
    British dissatisfaction with the cost of EC membership has
long been a source of friction, and diplomats said the
proposals could well reopen the wound.
    This was despite a proposed correction of Britain's budget
contribution to reflect its inability to take full advantage of
the EC's farm subsidies system because of the relatively small
size of its agricultural sector.
    Diplomats said although other nations such as Italy,
Belgium and the Netherlands were certain to oppose elements in
the system which could also substantially increase their own EC
payments, the main opposition was expected from Britain.
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has made clear in recent
statements that she is not prepared to abandon the present
system, under which Britain is refunded two-thirds of its net
payments to the EC, unless a fairer system is devised.
    The diplomats said Thatcher was unlikely to consider the
proposed system as fair.
    The Commission's proposals would base a state's
contribution on its gross national product, which the
commission says is a fairer measurement reflecting relative
wealth.
    The main element of the previous system was a share of
value added tax collected in member states.
    The mechanism to compensate Britain for its inability to
take up a higher proportion of EC farm expenditure will have to
be paid for by the other 11 states.
    The Commission has also proposed to end repayments to all
states of a service charge paid to them for collecting customs
duties on behalf of the EC.

606,"The International Primary Market Makers
Association, a trade organisation, said its board last week
adopted new rules recommending lead managers of eurodollar bond
issues make a market in that security for 12 months.
    Currently, while there is an implied obligation on the part
of firms to make markets in issues they underwrite, there is no
formal obligation to do so.
    Christopher Sibson, secretary general of IPMA, in
explaining why the recommendation was adopted, said ""It is aimed
at the problem of the lead manager who does a deal and
disappears.""
    Sibson said the organization cannot force its members to
adhere to the rule. ""We're under no illusions about the legal
binding force of these recommendations,"" he said.
    Lead managers have occasionally abandoned efforts to
support an unprofitable issue just a short while after it has
been offered, leaving investors and smaller firms with no one
to buy it back from them.
    Most recently, when prices of perpetual floating rates
notes (FRNs) suddenly plunged, most market makers abandoned the
securities altogether, leaving investors stuck with about 17
billion dlrs worth of unmarketable securities on their books.
     Sibson noted that the recommendation adopted by the board
only applies  to fixed-rate dollar issues and would not have
helped the floating rate sector out of its current crisis.
    Among other measures, the IPMA also decided that the
criteria for membership should be tightened to exclude some of
the smaller firms.
    Under the new rules, a firm must be the book running lead
manager during the two preceding years of 12 internationally
distributed debt issues denominated in U.S. Dlrs or in one of
eight other major currencies.
    The former requirement called for three lead-managed
issues. Sibson said he expects the tighter entrance
requirements to pare 3he current list of 67 members down by six
to 10 members.
    Smaller firms have criticized IPMA's efforts to restrict
membership to the larger firms, saying it is anti-competitive
and that it reinforces the big firms' already large market
share.
    ""Belonging to IPMA carries a certain amount of prestige with
borrowers,"" said a dealer at a small foreign bank. ""The borrower
says to himself, ""Well I can travel economy or I can travel
first class,'"" he said.
    Sibson defended the new rules saying ""We have to steer a
course between representing the interests of the major market

    Dealers said that the rule would enable investors and

investors more confident of trading in the eurobond market and

608,"The European Community (EC) executive
Commission will today urgently consider whether to take a new
initiative to break the current deadlock over reform of the
bloc's farm policy and to ease its budgetary crisis.
    The Commission will meet in Strasbourg following what
diplomats described as a largely fruitless special joint
meeting of farm and finance ministers on the issue in
Luxembourg Monday.
    Commission officials said farm commissioner Frans
Andriessen will ask the 17-man body for permission to present
farm ministers with a compromise plan revising proposals for
1987/88 farm prices which have divided them since they were
first announced in March.
    The most controversial aspects of these proposals are a
plan to tax all vegetable and marine oils and fats to finance
rapidly increasing production subsidies and technical measures
which would change the way common EC farm prices are converted
into member state currencies.
    West German delegation sources, who have opposed both plans
fiercely, said if the Commission dropped the oils and fats tax
plan and modified the currency proposals, there would be a
chance of agreement on other aspects of the package.
      These include measures to cut the effective price paid to
farmers for cereals and some other crops by over 10 pct.
      But a Commission spokesman said any new proposals would
include plans for revising the current oils and fats and
currency regulations.
     The Commission is anxious to avoid a complete deadlock in
meetings of EC farm ministers here this week as it fears issues
could then be referred to the EC heads of government summit at
the end of the month.
    Commission president Jacques Delors, who wants to ensure
the summit has ample time to consider proposals for new means
of financing the cash-strapped EC, said yesterday it would be
""disastrous"" if farm issues had to be discussed by government
leaders.
    However, with a five billion European Currency Unit (5.75
billion dollar) EC budget deficit almost inevitable this year,
the Commission will be wary of making major concessions to the
traditionally free-spending farm ministers, diplomats said
    Belgian finance minister Mark Eyskens, who chaired
yesterday's joint meeting of ministers, said afterwards some
aspects of the farm price package will almost certainly have to
be referred to the summit.
    Although Delors' aides described the joint meeting as
useful in clarifying the issues, some diplomats said it seemed
to have merely confirmed member states' long held positions.
    Indeed, they said an extra state, Spain, seemed to have
lined up with the four others already opposing the oils and
fats tax, West Germany, Britain, Denmark and Portugal.

this acquisition would seriously affect the company's

two billion dlrs of excess cash and marketables and about five

    In addition, the minority interest and deferred income
taxes attributable to Standard Oil would be excluded from
British Petroleum's capitalization. That would result in a

632,"Demand for natural gas has failed to
grow in proportion to the decline in oil deliveries because of
concerns over unresolved regulatory issues in the United
States, said industry analysts and gas utility company sources.
    ""Natural gas is not free to compete,"" said Larry Makovich,
director of utilities service at Data Resources Inc, ""problems
on pipeline open access and take-or-pay liabilities still weigh
heavily on end-users' decision to switch to natural gas.""
    A manager with an East Coast gas distribution company,
agreed that reluctance among end-users often stemmed from fear
of unresolved regulatory issues.
    ""The fact that at the federal level open access is not yet
firmly in place threatens to impede free flow of natural gas
from producers to consumers,"" he said.
     Michael German, an economist with the American Gas
Association, said while a significant amount of gas was now
replacing oil in dual-fuel boilers, the progress of expanding
the marketshare of gas was slow. First quarter natural gas
consumption data is not available until June.
    In the first three months of 1987, residual fuel demand
fell by an average of 55,000 barrels per day, according to the
American Petroleum Institute. Natural gas, however, was not
able to take full advantage of the decline in oil consumption.
    AGA's German said that while industrial consumers were
concerned with regulatory issues in their long-range capital
investment decisions, in the dual-fuel boiler market relied on
spot purchases.
    ""With all the capability of switching (from oil to natural
gas) already there, price of the fuel is the only concern,"" he
said, adding that compared with the same period last year,
January natural gas price at burner tip is 16 pct lower for
industrial users and 32 pct lower for utilities.
    German attributed the sluggish performance of natural gas
to lower demand in the utility sector as a whole.
    ""March was warmer than normal, which cut down gas
consumption not only in home heating but also in electricity
generation,"" he said.
     In March, according to API monthly statistics, residual
fuel deliveries fell by 13.6 pct to 1.2 mln barrels per day
from the same period a year ago.
    While API specifically mentioned lower natural gas prices
had put residual fuel at a price disadvantage among electric
utilities and industrial users, industry analysts believed the
role of natural gas was over-stated.
    Makovich of DRI noted much of the decline in oil in the
fuel mix was taken up by new nuclear capacity coming on stream
in the last few years.
    Nuclear capacity rose nine pct in 1986, and he projected
the same rate of growth for 1987 and 11 pct growth in 1988. 
    In contrast, oil and gas together represented only 15 pct
of the fuel mix in 1986 and should decline to 13 pct by 1989,
he said. Within this sector, gas share fell to 66 pct in 1986
from 76 pct a year ago due to competition from falling oil
prices, he added. But this year, gas was expected to recapture
only two pct of the share, Makovich said.
    Michael German of AGA agreed and said, ""Nevertheless,
outlet for several hundred billion cubic feet of gas a year is

came mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion
U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and
March 4.
    He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because
Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade
surplus to decline over the next few months as a result.
    Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise,
but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion
U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987.
    In January, Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct
on some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S.
Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus
with the U.S. Taiwan's 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2
billion, according to official statistics.
    Wang Chang-Ming, Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, told Reuters the government is
planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half
of this year.
    The reserves could support imports of more than two years
for Taiwan, compared with about three months for Japan and the

649,"Lured by the weakening dollar and the
conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, European
energy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reserves
to replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said.
    They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable
United States is good insurance against future shortages.
However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up
competition among European firms, well-heeled U.S.
institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice
domestic oil properties.
    Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil and
gas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyers
had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. All
buyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a
barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for
acquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five
dlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research.
    ""Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, but
we're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in,"" said
Arthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist and
president of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn.
    ""Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil and
gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,"" he added.
    Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe
the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because
of the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception that
oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to
buy new reserves than to explore for them.
    Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks to
the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and
general restructuring throughout the oilpatch.
    In two of the biggest transactions of recent months,
French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of <Total Compagnie
Francaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs to
separately acquire oil assets of Texas International <TEICC>
and Lear Petroleum Partners <LPP>. A spokesman for Minatome
said the company is searching for additional acquisitions.
    A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, <Petrofina S.A.>
and <Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy
virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos <WMB>,
the Oklahoma pipeline firm.
    But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures
with experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan's
<Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc's <TX> Texaco USA in a
100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined with
Dupont's <DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal.
    Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, its
geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are
more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions
than relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula.
    Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representing
International Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of <Preussag
Corp> and <C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm had
earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in
Texas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months.
    But he called that a small amount compared to the amount
other investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber's Geodyne
Energy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend up
to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties.
    ""The competition is stiff, not only from other foreign
investors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil
companies,"" he said. ""Our company is shopping around because we
feel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration. If
you're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you need
prices higher than the current market,"" he added.
    In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage
houses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were also
competing for prime properties.
    Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group
<RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying and
selling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquired
two billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels of
oil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said.
    ""Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these
companies,"" Smith said. ""Domestic production has dropped by one
mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may
drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988.""

650,"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's
diminishing hopes of overhauling the tax system have been dealt
a serious blow by reports of sharply higher than expected tax
revenues in 1986/87, government officials said.
    Nakasone has argued that the tax system must be reformed to
provide the revenue for more than 1,000 billion yen of tax cuts
promised in the government's emergency economic package last
month. But his argument has been undercut by reports that the
1986/87 tax take was as much as 2,500 billion yen more than
expected.
    That means the government should have more than enough
money in the fiscal year ending next March to pay for the
planned tax cuts without having recourse to the unpopular tax
measures proposed by Nakasone, one official said.
    The Prime Minister has proposed an indirect tax and the
abolition of tax breaks on small savings as ways of raising
revenue to offset the tax cuts.
    But stiff opposition has forced him to shelve the idea of
an indirect tax, at least for the time being. He still hopes to
gain parliamentary approval next month to abolish tax breaks on
small savings.
    The higher than expected revenues in 1986/87 partly stemmed
from increased receipts from land and securities taxes, as
prices of both shares and land soared, one official said.
    But corporate tax revenues have also been more buoyant than
expected, perhaps indicating the recession of the last year
induced by the strong yen was not as bad as thought, he said.
    The final figures for 1986/87 revenues are due to be
released by the Finance Ministry on July 1.
    The higher revenues last fiscal year have also undercut
attempts by the Finance Ministry's budget bureau to reduce
investment spending by government departments in the 1988/89
budget, several officials said.
    A budget bureau official said the bureau still wanted to
stick with its so-called ""minus-ceiling"" policy, which calls for
government departments to reduce investment spending by five
pct a year.
    But he acknowledged this would be difficult, given the
sharp increase in revenues last fiscal year and heavy domestic
and U.S. Pressure on the ministry to stimulate the economy.

subsidiary seeking to take over of Borg-Warner Corp said it
could realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts, whether or not
the deal, which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs, succeeds.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30
mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealer
manager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed.
    But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mln
dlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another party
holding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct.
    The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in any
tender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealer
manager services or for break-up of the deal.
    Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group of
investors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tender
offer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock.
    The company's board has approved the plan, which was
intended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp.
    Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series A
preferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a
share exercise price before the merger is effective, it said.
    Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possible
leveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December.
    At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it would
consider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,
if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it said
it was told the company had decided against a buyout.
    But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a
share proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said.
    Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner
management was asked not to take part in the new deal and it
was conditioned upon payment of the fees.
    In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will also
get up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in
the tender offer.
    Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner
as a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their
positions.
    But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it is
considering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of
subsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.
    All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130
mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal.
    Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt
of Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said.
    To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects to
borrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln
dlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of
non-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch

suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
commercial bank debt and related actions ""may require Citicorp
to place 3.9 billion dlrs of intermediate and long-term
Brazilian loans on a cash basis.""
    When loans are placed on a cash basis, interest or
principal payments are only booked when received instead of
being accrued on their due dates, analysts noted.

have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, the
chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.
    Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of the
use of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms are
possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending,
said Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculture
subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.
    Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and
Feed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from the
House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have
to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion
dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.
    Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be
made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988
budget, Glickman added.
    Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's 
proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.
    ""The administration's target price proposals are dead in
the water,"" he said.
    To cut the budget, Glickman said, ""everthing is on the
table,"" except those moves that would reduce farmers' income.
    Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee
will study in order to cut farm spending.
    Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and
1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which he
said would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.
    Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or ""pik')
certificates will also be another option his committee will
study, Glickman said.
    While not committing himself for or against such action, he
said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which
indicate certificates cost more than cash payments.
    Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and
tightening up of the person definition for annual payment
limitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.
    He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by
five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move
that could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he would
not be in favor of such a change.
    Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program's,
EEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being
used up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expand
this program while making cuts in other areas.
    Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said.
    ""I don't see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping
block,"" Glickman said.

shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at
least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.
    The official said Ecuador could resume exports after
repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links
jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.
It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,
the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35
days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.
    The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the
12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the
pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil
accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as
60 pct of government revenues.
    Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping
about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd
above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy
Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of
173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.
    However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,
costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian
pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take
about 60 days to build.
    Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,
had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end
of January, about equal to one month's imports.
    It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion
dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's
total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in
Latin America.
    In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would
loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three
months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.

and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in
repayment in May, Lusinchi said.

709,"In the fast paced personal computer
industry, millions can be made in six months, and such an
opportunity may exist now for companies seeking to capitalize
on the delay of a new IBM software standard.
    When International Business Machines Corp <IBM> announced
its new generation of personal computers, the PS/2 family, in
April, it also decided to establish a new operating system for
the machines, a death sentence for the billions of dollars of
software now in use on the existing system.
    Because IBM is the world's largest computer company - some
70 pct of the world's computers bear the IBM logo - most
industry analysts, and even IBM's competitors, expect that
within two years the new operating system, called OS/2, will be
as commonplace as the current standard, MS-DOS, is now.
    ""By 1989, at least one half to 60 pct of all personal
computers will be sold with OS/2,"" predicted George Colony,
president of the consulting firm Forrester Research Inc.
    But until then there is an opportunity, some analysts said,
for firms selling advanced versions of MS-DOS, specialised
multi-tasking software packages and Unix, an alternative to
MS-DOS developed by American Telephone and Telegraph Co <T>
that has developed a following among engineers and the federal
government.
    OS-2, which IBM is developing with Microsoft Corp, the
author of MS-DOS, will not be ready for another six months. IBM
said last week that the product is on schedule but analysts and
other software developers are skeptical, since delays in major
new software products are commonplace.
    Initial acceptance of the new system will most likely be
hindered by the disgruntlement of hardware and software vendors
alike, who would prefer to keep making products that work with
tried and true MS-DOS, according to Paul Cubbage, software
analyst with the market research firm Dataquest Inc.
    Compaq, IBM's major personal computer competitor, has
already said it will stick with the MS-DOS standard. Compaq
president Rod Canion said recently their will be no ""automatic
mass migration"" to OS/2. ""(Advanced MS-DOS) applications will
continue to meet a far broader set of users needs than OS/2
will supply long after it becomes available,"" he said.
    Cubbage acknowledged that ""it will probably be a year or
more before any really useful applications are available for
OS-2,"" creating opportunities for multi-tasking programs. ""But
there comes a time when the memory limits of those gets to
you,"" he said.
    IBM's new operating system was as big an event to the
computer industry as the PS-2 announcement itself. The new
computers, the most powerful of which will use Intel Corp's
fast 80386 microprocessor, are expected to rejuvenate the
sagging sales of the personal computer industry and already
gave a big boost to IBM.
    Company officials said last week that 250,000 PS/2s were
shipped in the 2-1/2 months since their introduction and IBM
expect record pc sales ths year as a result.
    The enthusiasm for the PS-2 is particularly striking since
the full potential of the powerful computers cannot be tapped
until a new operating system or other high level software is
available, analysts said.
    OS-2 will allow users to work on many different programs,
or tasks, at once on a personal computer, ideally without any
slowdown in operation, a capability the industry has long
strived for.
    Microsoft is already promising alternatives to OS-2, in
particular an advanced version of its Windows multitasking
program, which is used in conjunction with MS-DOS.
    Microsoft chairman Bill Gates has suggested an advanced
version of the program, Windows 386, will be announced in
September and available six to eight weeks later, at a price of
100 dlrs and 300 dlrs. OS/2 is expected to cost 325 dlrs.

    Some software developers have said the the program,
designed for 80386-based personal computers, may even be
superior to OS/2 in allowing users to multitask applications
without disruption.
     But several analysts commented that what users really want
is a multi-taksing operating system for 80386-based personal
computers, and so far that desire has been met primarily by a
small Atlanta software publisher, The Software Link Inc. In
late spring the company announced PC-MOS/386, a multi-tasking,
multiuser operating system that is compatible with MS/DOS and
works on 80386-based computers.
    The company said it filled 2,500 orders in the first four
weeks of availability and expects shipments to reach 40,000 by
year end.
    International Data Corp analyst Will Zachmann said Unix
could be the most promising alternative to OS/2, even once the
IVM system is available.
    IBM did not endorse Unix for any of its PS/2 models,
although it did say that it would announce a version of its
Advanced Interactive Executive (AIX), a Unix compatible
operating system.
    But the federal government requires Unix compatability for
most of its computer contracts, it is almost certain that other
companies will provide Unix-style operating systems for the IBM
systems.
    ATT itself two weeks ago introduced a version of Unix that
is compatible with the 80386 microprocessor, although not IBM's
computer specifically.
    Analysts saw the announcement as a move to get Unix
accepted as a strong alternative to OS/2 before the IBM system
has a chance to take off.

717,"The European Community (EC) has
warned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough trade
legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S.
trading partners.
    The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, head
of the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
    A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters.
    Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backed
aspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under the
GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry.
    But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would
require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action
against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and
would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade
practices.
    Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit
member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in
trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved.
    He said ""If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory,
then the United States would be in violation of its
international legal obligations and on a collision course with
its major trading partners.""
    Denman added that a president should have flexibility in
enforcing trade laws, saying ""in the last resort, any
administration must take its decision in light of the overall
national interest.""
    Otherwise, he said, ""the risk would be counter-reaction by
trading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation or
enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against
imports from the United States.""
    Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it
reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for
firms to file unfair trade practice claims.
    Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards
for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms.
    ""Changes in these standards must be agreed upon
multilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United States
alone on the world trading system,"" he said.
    House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state
legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb
imports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two
years ago but vetoed by President Reagan.
    There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the
entire trade bill because of the textile amendment.

offering 150 mln dlrs of secured notes due 1994 with an 8.60
pct coupon and par pricing, said J.P. Morgan Securities Inc,
acting as lead manager of its first corporate debt deal.
    ""To our knowledge, this is the first time that an affiliate
of a bank holding company has been a manager of a corporate
bond offering in the U.S.,"" a spokesman for J.P. Morgan and Co
Inc said.
    J.P. Morgan Securities is an affiliate of J.P. Morgan and
Co, the fifth largest bank in the U.S.
    The J.P. Morgan spokesman explained that because the PEFCO
notes are guaranteed by the U.S. government, the securities
affiliate was not prohibited by the Glass-Steagall Act from
underwriting the issue.
    Indeed, Bankers Trust Co and Citicorp Investment Bank,
which are affiliates of Bankers Trust New York Corp and
Citicorp respectively, were co-managers of the PEFCO offering.
    Passed by Congress in 1933, Glass-Steagall bars commercial
banks from owning brokerage firms and engaging in such
investment banking activities as underwriting corporate
securities or municipal revenue bonds.
    Last year, several major U.S. banks formed investment
banking affiliates and applied to the Federal Reserve Board for
authorization to offer commercial paper and underwrite and
trade municipal revenue bonds and some forms of mortgage-backed
securities.
    J.P. Morgan Securities received permission from the Fed
several weeks ago for these activities, the spokesman said.
    But the Securities Industry Association, a trade group of
investment banking firms, appealed the decision. J.P. Morgan
also appealed because it believed the Fed placed too many
restrictions on the bank's affiliate, the spokesman said.
    ""The Securities and Exchange Commission got a stay, so we
are not engaging in those activities,"" the J.P. Morgan
spokesman said.
    ""We are perfectly eligable to underwrite this offering. We
are endeavoring to prove that there is nothing mysterious about
this business,"" the spokesman said.
    He added, ""Ruling off certain markets does not serve the
public policy.
    J.P. Morgan Securities was formed in April 1986 with
capitalization of 250 mln dlrs, the spokesman said. At year-end
1986, the firm had 261.5 mln dlrs of capital.
    Dillon, Read and Co Inc, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and
Salomon Brothers Inc also served as co-managers of the PEFCO
deal.
    The issue's yield was 50 basis points over comparable
Treasury securities. The notes are non-callable for life. A
top-flight AAA rating by Moody's and Standard and Poor's is
anticipated.
    The gross spread is 5.75 dlrs, the selling concession is

challenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group
of Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates
are the key to smoothing world trade problems.
    Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say
they are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currencies
are the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan
shrinking?
    What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down
made world trade problems worse rather than solving them,
fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of
world trade recession?
    U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar
fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five
pact in New York.
    The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct
more competitive in Japan. The officials, most of them
economists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.
    Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan rising
rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined
only 11 pct against the yen.?
    Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely
interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar
must go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?
    At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials can
only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.
    ""I don't know and I don't think anyone knows,"" said Hugh
Richardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.
    ""What I do know is that Community exporters are making a
hell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, there
is money to be made in Japan,"" he added.
    But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S.
Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade
practices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such as
agriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonable
checking and customs procedures for car imports.
    Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the
face of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, they
blame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.

    Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5
pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at
least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange
personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.
    ""The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the
Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,"" said one analyst.
    But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.
    ""U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,
we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three
years, not until the 21st century,"" Komatsu said.
    Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes
into the securities business at home.
    Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's
version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial
from investment banking.
    But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu
said he hopes further deregulation will create new
opportunities.
    ""We need to find new business chances,"" Komatsu said. ""In some
cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust
bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.""
    Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such
domestic securities business as profitable government bond
dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co
Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.
    He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering
the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank
subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.
     The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to
securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,
following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European
universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.
    But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar
decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.
    ""We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed
in two or three years,"" he said.
    Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand
lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to
replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.
    The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of
time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the
merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.
    ""It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,"" said
Kleinwort's Smithson.
    ""After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling
around. It will be the next decade before we see if the
strategy is right or wrong.""

761,"The worst may be just about over for
Japan's battered economy but economists said they do not expect
a vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economists
polled by Reuters said the economy's 18 month-old slowdown is
likely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising
exports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. ""The
economy will bottom out in the middle of the year,"" said
Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido.
    Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu
Taketomi agreed. ""It (the bottom) is in the offing,"" he said.
    But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in the
fiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct,
from two pct in the current year, he said.
    Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst
are increasing.
    The volume of exports in the first two months of the year
rose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining toward
the end of last year.
    Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a
sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks,
several economists said it could mark the beginning of a
recovery.
    Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smaller
than expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3
pct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan survey
released last week showed that the decline in Japanese
corporate earnings may be nearing its end.
    And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes
the rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said.
    Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And
West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise
currencies around current levels.
    The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two
years has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its
companies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market.
    ""The important thing is the exchange rate,"" Taketomi said.
    If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise
investment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs
of that yet, economists said.
    A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their
competitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to
recover, economists said.
    Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some
loosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said Haruo
Muto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
    The next reading of the economy's health should come early
next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter,
1986.
    Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from
the previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct.
    But a senior government official said the fourth quarter
figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point
quarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical
aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity.
    To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the
economy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth
quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong.
     The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a
statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of
1986, the official said.
    Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also
distorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the second
half of 1986.
    Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their
purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer
expenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December
because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year
bonuses, they said.
    As the government had to buy back some of the coins from
retailers because they were unsold, the government's
contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been
boosted, economists said.
    Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from
government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last
year was good.
    The senior government official said the fourth quarter
performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than
generally expected, while that of the external sector was
better.

group has offered to reopen the Benguela railroad that runs
through UNITA-held territory and links landlocked Zaire and
Zambia to the Angolan port of Lobito.
    UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, in a statement made in his
Jamba headquarters in southern Angola and released by UNITA's 
Washington office, said he was prepared to guarantee safe
passage for non-military freight as a gesture of ""peace and
reconciliation.""
    Savimbi challenged the Cuban-backed Angolan government,
which controls the port, to match his offer and allow goods to
pass through. There was no immediate response from Luanda.
    UNITA has been fighting the Cuban-backed Angolan government
since 1976.
    The offer of a rail route to the Atlantic would help South
Africa's black neighbors reduce their economic dependence on
South Africa.
    The U.S. Congress is currently considering a proposal to
spend some 500 mln dlrs to build another railroad to help these
states become less dependent on South Africa.
    The Beira corridor runs through Mozambique to Tanzania's
Indian ocean ports but Savimbi suggested the Benguela route as
an alternative.
    ""The Benguela route can safely open immediately,"" he said. ""It
will provide the transportation our neighbors need, and it will
not cost the Americans the money they say it will cost to open

number of cooperatives to meet minimum capital requirements,

    In April, GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a
partnership formed by AFG Industries Inc <AFG> and Wagner and
Brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase
of up to 54 pct, or 12.5 mln shares, of its common at 130 dlrs
a share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs
    As part of the restructuring, GenCorp also said it planned
to sell its tire business, the bottling operations of its RKO
General Inc subsidiary, and RKO's remaining broadcast
properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive
components businesses.
   
    Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrs
in after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale of
several pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company,
including general tire.
    ""The price paid for General tire would not cause us to
reevaluate that estimate,"" said Tilden.
    General Tire employs 10,000 people worldwide and has four
tire manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada.
    In a statemnet, A. William Reynolds, GenCorp chairman said
the sale of General Tire ""represents a critical accomplishment
in our plan to restructure GenCorp.""
   
    Reynolds also said GenCorp's previously announced sale of
its other businesses are ""proceeding satisfactorily.""
    Among the pieces of Gencorp's empire that remain to be sold
are its RKO bottling operations. GenCorp agreed to sell RKO's
KHJ-TV station to Walt Disney Co <DIS> for
217 mln dlrs. That deal awaits approval by the Federal
Communications Commission. GenCorp also received 257 dlrs after
tax from the sale of RKO's WOR-TV.

trading at midsession, with moderate losses in coupon issues
and Treasury bill rates near unchanged.
    Bills improved slightly on remarks from Federal Reserve
chairman Paul Volcker that a restrictive monetary policy would
be damaging to investment and that last week's increases in
U.S. banks' prime lending rates to 7.75 pct from 7.50 pct was
not connected with Fed policy, dealers said.
     Coupon issues were 1/32 to 5/16 lower, pressured by a weak
dollar. Treasury bill rates were anywhere from three basis
points lower to one basis point higher.
    The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond was 5/16 lower at 95-26/32
to yield 7.87 pct compared with 7.84 pct at yesterday's close.
    Dealers said remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker indicating that exchange rates had adjusted enough to
narrow the U.S. trade deficit and warning that a further,
sizable dollar fall could be counterproductive had little
exchange rate impact as they were seen as a reiteration of his
views.
    In any case, they said the dollar is expected to be under
pressure while monetary officials of leading industrial nations
meet this week in Washington, which may hurt bonds.
    Dealers said three-month bill rates had eased early in the
session on a few sizable buy orders from retail accounts, but
that otherwise there was little activity in this sector.
    ""When Volcker hit the tape it helped bills, because it
makes people think the Fed is not going to tighten,"" a bill
trader said. ""But it's a nervous trade, with no real buyers.""
    Three-month bills were bid at 5.50 pct, three basis points
below their price at yesterday's auction, while six-month bills
rose one basis point from their auction price to 5.64 pct bid.
    Year bills rose one basis points to 5.74 pct bid.
    Most economists expected the Federal Reserve to supply
temporary reserves, but most had forecasted an indirect
injection via customer repurchase agreements rather than a
direct injection via two-day system repurchases which the Fed
conducted at its usual intervention time.

pct. Funds opened at this level and remained there at midday,
down from yesterday's 6.20 pct avearge.

very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain
small. ""Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their

case against Wall Street arbitrageur Ivan Boesky was dismissed

    Federal Judge Ann C. Williams, in an oral ruling, said FMC
had not been harmed by trading in FMC stock by Boesky and other
traders prior to FMC's two-billion dlr recapitalization last
year.
    FMC had claimed insider trading by Boesky had forced it to
increase the value of the recapitalization to 80 dlrs a share
from 70 dlrs a share.
    FMC had charged that Boesky received confidential
information about FMC's planned recapitalization from Dennis
Levine, a former merger specialist with Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.
    An FMC spokeswoman said in response to an inquiry that FMC
might appeal the ruling, made in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois, once a formal written
decision is received. The written ruling is expected April 15.
    The spokeswoman said FMC might appeal alleged contract
violations involved in the dispute. That part of the case,
involving a contract between FMC and Goldman Sachs and Co,
would be appealed to an Illinois state court, she said.
    Goldman Sachs was FMC's investment banker in its planned
restructuring. A FMC spokeswoman said the contract was a
standard contract under which Goldman Sachs advised FMC on the
restructuring.
    ""We are certainly taking a look at appealing"" the ruling in
Illinois state court, the FMC spokeswoman said in response to
an inquiry.
    The suit claimed that Boesky bought 95,300 FMC shares
between February 18 and February 21, 1986, selling those shares
for a profit of 975,000 dlrs on February 21, the day FMC first
said it was considering a recapitalization.

shares between March 12 and April four, acknowledging the
purchase of a 7.5 pct stake in the company in a 13-D filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April seven.
    ""We alleged his actions kept the stock price artificially

Five, a unit of Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc, is offering 500 mln

    Sole manager Kidder Peabody said the first floating-rate
class has an initial rate of 6.755 pct that will be reset
quarterly at 40 basis points over three-month LIBOR, with an 11
pct cap.
    Totaling 53.3 mln dlrs, this floating-rate class contains a
so-called catchup provision that allows investors to recapture
possible lost interest, according to Kidder Peabody.
    For instance, if three-month LIBOR rises to 15 pct during
the life of the floating-rate tranche and falls back below the
11 pct cap, investors would be paid back, dollar for dollar,
the amount of interest they would have received if the CMOs did
not carry a maximum interest rate, a Kidder officer said.
    Kidder Peabody introduced this concept on February 12.
    The other floating-rate class totals 132.4 mln dlrs and has
an initial rate of 6.975 pct that will be reset quarterly at 60
basis points over three-month LIBOR, with a 13 pct cap. This
tranche does not have a catch-up provision, the Kidder officer

1.8097 times three-month LIBOR.

alternate buyer lined up for its Fairchild Semiconductor unit,
Wall Street analysts said.
    ""I think its clear that in cancelling its agreement with
Fujitsu, Schlumberger has signaled that it has another deal in
the works,"" said Paul Johnson, a semiconductor analyst with
L.F. Rothschild.
    ""There are unquestionably other buyers out there,"" added
Kidder Peabody analyst Adam F. Cuhney. ""A lot of companies have
looked at Fairchild and would be willing to buy it.""
    Among the companies that would be interested in bidding for
Fairchild are Advanced Micro Devices <AMD>, Sunnyvale, Calif.,
and LSI Logic Corp <LLSI>, Milpitas, Calif., industry analysts
said.
    Top U.S. chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp <NSM>,
Texas Instruments Inc <TXN> and Motorola Inc <MOT> might also
seek to buy Fairchild, but could possibly run into antitrust
problems, the analysts added.
    Moreover, Fairchild's management is thought to be
considering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino,
Calif., company, analysts said.
    In a brief statement announcing the termination of the
agreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision opened
up other possibilities, including a possible buyout by
Fairchild management.
    The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu would
have bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs,
because rising opposition to the deal by the Reagan
administration made it unlikely that the sale could be
completed within a reasonable period of time.
    Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing that
the companies did not need government approval to complete the
transaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-owned
companies.
    ""Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because
the U.S. government didn't want it,"" said Johnson of L.F.
Rothschild.
    A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on the
company's news release.
    He said only that the company was reviewing a number of
possible alternatives for the Fairchild unit.
    Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediately
available for comment.
    Analysts noted the significance of the government's
apparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control of
Fairchild.
    Administration officials, including Commerce Secretary
Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger,
feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese control
of key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military
weapons systems.
    ""The government really stood up for the semiconductor
industry,"" said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. ""That, I think, is
the real significance of this.""
    Consequently, analysts said, the Japanese government might
now feel more pressure to address U.S. complaints about
Japanese chipmakers' violation of the semiconductor trade
agreement signed last summer.

895,"Eurodollar bonds closed as much as a full
point lower as the dollar fell to a post-war low against the
yen and interest rates on U.S. Treasuries rose almost to eight
pct.
    The dollar fell to 144.30 yen and recovered only slightly
after foreign exchange traders in New York said the Federal
Reserve intervened to buy dollars for yen.
    But despite the dollar's woes, Japan Development Bank,
wholly owned by the Japanese government, raised 150 mln dlrs in
a seven-year eurobond carrying an eight pct coupon.
    Lead manager for the issue, Bank of Tokyo, said the deal,
at the time of pricing, was to yield 60 basis points over
comparable maturity Treasuries. However, by the close of
trading, that spread had narrowed to 55 and continued to slide
in aftermarket activity.
    Dealers noted that the spread to Treasuries is wide for a
newly-priced AAA-rated borrower like Japan Development Bank.
For example, earlier this week, the World Bank raised U.S. Dlrs
at only 25 basis points over Treasuries. Dealers said that
because the borrower comes to market fairly infrequently -- the
last time was about nine months ago, the spread appears wide.
    But officials at Bank of Tokyo said the spread is intended
to compensate for the lack of liquidity and for the uncertainty
currently associated with owning dollar securities.
    The officials said the borrower opted to raise funds in
dollars, despite the currency's weakness, because it is the
only market deep enough to accommodate an issue of that size.
Japan Development Bank is not allowed to raise euroyen.
    Market sources said the deal is likely to be swapped into
yen as the borrowers previous issues were.
    Late in the day, the deal was trading just inside its fees
at less 1.75 less 1.55.
    Also issued today was a 40 mln dlr five-year offering from
Toshiba International Finance (Netherlands) carrying a 7-3/8
pct coupon and priced at 101-1/2.
    Three equity linked dollar denominated deals were offered,
the largest of which was a 200 mln dlr offering by Sekisui
Chemical Co and guaranteed by Sanwa Bank Ltd. The issue has
equity warrants attached and late in the day it was quoted on
brokers' screens at 106-1/2, bid only.
    The Australian dollar market continued active, with
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce offering a bond of 125 mln
five-year with a zero coupon priced at 54.
    Late in the day, the deal was quoted at less 1-1/4 bid. A
similar deal yesterday by Toronto Dominion, priced slightly
higher at 54.37 pct for an effective yield of 13.52 pct, was
quoted slightly lower at less 1.37 less 1.25 pct.
    Dealers said that investors are apparently willing to
accept zero-coupon bonds yielding 50 to 100 basis points less
than annual-pay bonds because their are tax benefits for retail
buyers. Also, the bonds are more volatile and if interest rates
fall in Australia as many analysts expect, the potential for
capital gains is greater with a zero-coupon. The bonds are also
better for those who expect the australian dlr to appreciate.
    Dealers said that the Australia dlr zero coupon bonds are
apparently being placed with retail accounts on the European
continent with very little placement being done in Japan.
    Euroyen issues sank slightly in line with prices on
domestic Japanese bond markets but recovered in late trade as
the yen soared. After the markets closed, the dollar fell to
144 yen.
    The European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a 40 mln euroyen
issue paying 4-5/8 pct over seven years. This is the second

there would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions

suspending the auction was that the central bank was low on
foreign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successful
bidders.    The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system
was first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15

945,"American Telephone and Telegraph Co
may have a hard time convincing U.S. regulatory authorities
that lifting controls on its long-distance business will
benefit consumers, industry and congressional analysts say.
    ""There's clearly going to have to be an effort (by ATT) to
say that deregulation will not have an adverse effect on the
consumer,"" said Gerry Salemme, a policy analyst for the House
telecommunications, consumer protection and finance
subcommittee.
    Salemme said that if the Federal Communications Commission
eased restrictions on ATT, Congress probably would consider
taking legislative oversight action to protect consumers'
interests.
    ATT has about 80 pct of the interstate long-distance
market. It asked the FCC to cut back price and rate regulations
that have control its long-distance phone business.
    ATT spun off its local telephone services operations into
the seven regional Bell companies in 1984 as part of the  court
ordered breakup of the telephone giant.
    The regional companies have been prohibited from
manufacturing equipment and from offering information services
and out-of-region long-distance service.
    But some of them want to move into those areas,
particularly the provision of long-distance services, which
would compete directly with ATT.
    ATT's request came in response to an FCC notice issued in
January that proposed to streamline regulation of certain parts
of its long-distance business.
    The FCC will closely examine the potential effects of the
proposal on consumers, said FCC spokeswoman Mary Beth Hess.
    ""That would be foremost in our mind,"" Hess said.
    Hess said she expected the FCC to respond in a few months.
    Congressional aides said they were concerned that if
regulation is reduced, ATT will use its dominant market
position to raise consumer rates.
    Consumer groups say ATT's concern for its business clients,
its most lucrative market, underscores a danger that, without
full regulation from the FCC, any increased costs will be
passed onto the consumer rather than big business.
    ATT, however, says deregulation would benefit consumers.
    The company would become more competitive because it would
not have to wait for FCC authorization before introducing new
services, spokeswoman Edith Herman said.
    However, Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation of
America, which represents more than 200 consumer groups
nationally, said, ""When ATT offers new services, they tend to be
geared toward the high volume business market rather than the
average consumer.""
    ATT proposed that in addition to lifting profit regulation,
the FCC allow new rates to go into effect in 14 days instead of
the current 45 days.
    The company also called for a reduction in the amount of
documentation it must file with the FCC each time it introduces
or changes long-distance services.
    ""With this filing, we're suggesting that regulators replace
a blanket approach to regulating ATT with a more finely-tuned,
targeted approach,"" said Lawrence Garfinkel, AT&T's vice
president of marketing services, in a statement.
    ""We believe that by using a scalpel instead of a meat axe,
the public interest can be protected and all consumers will
benefit,"" he added.
    MCI Communications Corp, also asked the FCC to ease
restrictions on ATT, saying this would encourage competition.
    Some industry analysts said the MCI proposal was an effort
to halt FCC-mandated price cuts that have forced ATT and its
rivals to cut prices, eroding profits in the industry. MCI lost
448.4 mln dlrs on sales of 3.59 billion dlrs last year.
    The analysts said the proposal would benefit MCI because
ATT would no longer impose price cuts that MCI would have to
follow when costs fell in the industry.
    ""I'm sort of mystified by those comments,"" retorted Herman, a
district manager for ATT.
    ""ATT (if deregulated) has no intention of not passing on
cost reductions,"" she added.
    Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation,
said he opposed deregulation because it left no alternatives
that would ensure against overcharging by ATT.
    He said the FCC had in the past instructed ATT to reduce
prices when the company was benefitting from lower costs from
increased use by consumers of long-distance services.
    Without full regulatory authority this may no longer
happen, he added.

Yugoslav firms, in turn, will export oil products to France.

958,"Britain and West Germany told their
European Community partners they would strongly oppose major
elements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses.
    At a meeting of EC foreign ministers, Britain called for a
full debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that has
already angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-led
protests from exporters to the EC, diplomats said.
    West Germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, will
advise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenance
other proposals that could hit German farmers, they added.
    They said West Germany's objections were put in a letter
this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, the
president of the EC's Executive Commission which had put
forward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new EC
cash crisis.
    Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cereals
production curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for a
proposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) -
a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level out
foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports.
    Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit German
farmers who, without MCAs, would find it much more difficult to
export to weaker currency states, which means virtually all
other 11 EC states, diplomats said.
    Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to impose
a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because it
could seriously damage EC trade relations.
    The diplomats said the United States had been the most
outspoken among foreign critics of the proposal, describing it
as a breach of the EC's obligations under the world trade body
GATT.
    But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC,
such as Senegal, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina,
Iceland and Norway, they added.
    Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farm
reform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures that
could spark a damaging trade war with the U.S.
    Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision on
either the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today,
diplomats said. But their discussion should make clear that
neither has a chance of surviving when it comes up for
substantive consideration by EC farm ministers later this
month, they added.

the downgrading of Denmark's credit rating by the U.S. Standard

importance.
    3tandard and Poor's yesterday lowered the rating on Danish
long-term external debt to AA from AA-plus, saying Denmark was
less competitive with rising labour costs and this would worsen
the external account deficit and increase external debt.
    Schlueter told journalists after the weekly cabinet
meeting: ""It is regrettable that they have taken a plus from us,
but the change will not have much practical significance.""
    He was echoing comments by central bank governor Erik
Hoffmeyer, who was quoted by the daily Politiken as saying the
downgrading would have little effect on Denmark's borrowing
capability or the interest it paid on loans.
    But some bank economists said the lower rating would
increase the cost of national borrowing to finance the external
current account deficit, which rose to a record 34.5 billion
crowns in 1986.
    Denmark had total foreign debt of over 260 mln crowns at
the end of 1986.
    Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said in a statement last
night that the downgrading, the second in four years, should
not be over-dramatised, pointing out that the government had
already imposed a series of austerity measures to limit
consumption and was willing to act again if necessary.
    Prices fell steeply when the Danish bond market opened but
recovered somewhat after the central bank cut the overnight
money market lending rate to 10.5 pct from 11 pct.

currency in March, following stabler currency relations after

990,"The head of a Philippine panel charged
with recovering illegal wealth accumulated by former President
Ferdinand Marcos and his associates said they still controlled
large funds circulating in the country's economy.
    Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government (PCGG) told Reuters in an interview: ""There is every
reason to believe that the cronies and President Marcos and his
family were able to hide millions and millions of pesos before
they fled. As a matter of fact we have been able to get hold of
crates of newly printed currency.""
    Diaz did not give figures, but said: ""We believe they still
have a lot of funds. These are the funds that they will use in
the coming elections. These are the funds that they used to
stage those coups.""
    He was referring to congressional elections scheduled for
May 11 and to the three coup attempts faced by President
Corazon Aquino since she toppled Marcos a year ago.
    Diaz said the PCGG so far has recovered cash and property
valued at about eight billion pesos and had sequestered shares
of stock of at least 286 firms. ""We have achieved more than what
we thought we could achieve in one year,"" he added.
    The PCGG, set up by Aquino in February 1986, has sweeping
powers of sequestration, seizure and inspection of bank
accounts. Diaz said the panel's main task is to gather evidence
for legal prosecution. ""But we have to sequester before we file
a case and that is the legal objection because they say that we
shoot first before we ask questions,"" he said.
    He said dividends from seized shares were held in trust
funds pending court verdicts, adding several Marcos associates
had made confessions about their wealth. He did not name them.
    ""They are very concerned and afraid that if their names
appear something may happen to them,"" he said.
    The government last week announced that businessman Antonio
Floirendo, an associate of Marcos known as the ""banana king,"" had
turned over 70 mln pesos in cash to the PCGG and promised to
surrender titles to property in New York and Hawaii worth
another 180 mln pesos. In return, the PCGG said it had lifted
freeze and sequestration orders on Floirendo's properties.
    Diaz said there were already similar preliminary agreements
with another Marcos associate, Roberto Benedicto. He said
Benedicto had surrendered control of several newspapers and
radio and television stations and agreed to PCGG control of the
boards of a bank and a hotel he owned in the Philippines.
    Diaz said the PCGG based its estimates of illegal wealth on
income-tax returns and land titles of Marcos associates.
""Anything over and above reported income -- that's what we have
to recover,"" he said.
    He said a decision by the PCGG last week to probe street
certificates held by brokers at Manila's two stock exchanges
was prompted by suspicion that illegal funds were in
circulation.
    Street certificates describe securities held in the name of
a broker or another nominee instead of a customer so as to
permit easy trading or transfer.
    Share prices at the two exchanges reacted nervously last
Tuesday when news of the probe leaked. The composite index at
the Manila Stock Exchange fell 18.61 points to 451.51, while
that at the Makati Stock Exchange slipped 1.7326 points to
close at 63.0618. There was a slight recovery the following
day.
    The presidents of the two exchanges appealed to Diaz to
carry out the probe discreetly so investors were not scared
away, saying street certificates did not necessarily indicate
""anomalous transactions.""
    ""It's unfortunate that (news of the probe) leaked out to the
papers,"" Diaz said.
    Diaz said PCGG suspicions were aroused by the stock market
boom over the past year. The Manila Stock Exchange composite
index jumped 224 pct from 131.32 to 424.81 in 1986.
    ""One of our functions is to see to it that these assets that
we have sequestered do not go right back into the hands of the
(Marcos) cronies,"" he said.
    ""We want to make sure that these stock exchanges are not
being manipulated by the cronies because maybe they want to
launder their pesos and that is why the prices are just
skyrocketing.""
    Diaz said the PCGG would limit its probe to sequestered
stock in brewery giant San Miguel Corp, the Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co, mining conglomerate Benguet Corp, and
Oriental Petroleum and Minerals Corp.
    Shares of the four companies are among the most frequently
traded on the two stock exchanges.
    Diaz said at a meeting with the heads of the two exchanges
last Thursday that the PCGG would act prudently in its
investigation of street certificates, adding the panel
supported government efforts to create a favourable investment
climate.

1003,"Sugar which EC producers plan to sell
into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for
sale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in its
latest sugar review.
    The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very
nominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to the
intervention price, with detrimental consequences for
producers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an
attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered
sugar.
    The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade
producers from their chosen course, such as removing the time
limit on storage contracts, which presently means that
intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September,
Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production
quotas being reduced.
    If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for
export, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at
recent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the difference
between the EC price and the world market price, the extra
costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says.
    The producers might have to repay these costs through
production levies and the proposed special elimination levy,
Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs
could be recovered under EC rules.
    The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes of
sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the
EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to
bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price,
Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of
protest designed to force the Commission's hand.
    In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered for
intervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure
that the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in
1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price,
West German producers face a further price reduction in July
with a probable revaluation of the ""green"" mark.
    Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem is
not expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared to
traders for some years that the EC's export policy is
insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, it
says.
    The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by
increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says,
suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut
down the amount of ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" surrounding the
export tender system.

likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.
    Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on ""a gradual reduction
of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.""
    He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced
""satisfactory exchange rate stability,"" in part thanks to heavy
coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and
he was ""content"" with sterling's exchange rate.
    Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May
currency reserves announced today he said, ""we have been playing
a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a
very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.""
    Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may
falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic
commitments underlying the accord.
    ""Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange
rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their
commitments in Paris ... In this respect."" He said the U.S.
Budget deficit was ""very important.""
    Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson
said, ""what is really needed in Japan is an increase in
merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.""
    ""There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural
goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is
wholly unjustified,"" he said.
    Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in ""Japan
bashing"" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation
package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase
Japanese development aid over the next three years.
    Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange
membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.
    He said he thought West Germany would instead come under
pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to
jack up faltering economic growth.
    In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring
forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts
scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with
the privatisation of German national industries.
    On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan
to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to
make progress in Venice.
    The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign
debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World
Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.
    Lawson said he would seek ""to consolidate political backing
for the plan at the Venice summit"" and hoped the programme would
be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.
    He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase
Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt
provisions.
    ""First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market
response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this
sort of move than they felt before Citicorp,"" he said.

strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.

determine the appropriate size of provisions.

supplementary budget but LDP officials have said it will amount
to more than 5,000 billion yen for fiscal 1987, which compares
with 2,000 billion provided for the previous year.
    ""It signalled a clear shift away from the conservative
fiscal policies of the past,"" said Kazuaki Harada, senior
managing director of Sanwa Research Institute.
    For the last five years the government has stuck to a
tight-fisted fiscal policy in its attempt to stop issuing
deficit financing bonds by 1990.
    But mounting foreign pressure for Japan to boost its
economy, hurt by the yen's extended rise, hurried the
government to hammer out a draft economic package and bring it
to the latest G-7 meeting.
    Harada said Japan should not view expansion of its economy
as the result of pressure but as an opportunity to lead world
economic growth.
    ""The Japanese economy has the potential to take a leadership
role and we should recognize it,"" Harada said.
    If Japan fails to meet such international expectations it
will invite some retaliatory moves, especially from the U.S.,
Which may result in a further rise of the yen, analysts said.
    The G-7 communique represented a test for Japan's
commitment to domestically-generated economic growth and to a
more balanced world trade structure, they said.

1024,"Advocates of a 0/92 plan for
feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a
disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is
scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressional
sources said.
    The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English
(D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to
implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat.
    An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987
wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that
scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers.
    Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat,
it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should
be treated equally, they said.
   If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then
supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not
offer their proposals next week, sources said.
   English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles
Stenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but
whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear.
    Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's first
choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat
farmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid
for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of
controversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an
even greater cutback in the bill, they said.
    Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still
receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.
    Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.)
have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to
include a 0/92 program for feedgrains.
    An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm
bill, but to be fair to all crops.
    Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would
likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are
greater than to idle the land, economists said.
    Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is
premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the
House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the
impacts of such a program.

1039,"The recent fall in world sugar prices,
due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export
availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China
and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said.
    Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of
China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should
limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly
market report.
   ""And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return
to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for
May/June shipment, Man added.
    The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May
shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total
purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said.
    Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln
tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5
mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being
countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3
mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier.
    Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could
be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar
production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down.
    Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks
in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to
boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not
be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates
Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln
tonnes.
    However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters
with reduced availability, Man said.
    Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen
to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free
market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which
has left exporters chasing falling import requirements.
    A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the
difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still
remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is
needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still
overhanging the market, Man said.
    The increasing cases of record production as a result of
record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers
to strive for greater efficiency.
    As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of
production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to
prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said.
    Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and
sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the
level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully
compensate producers when exporting on the world market.
    Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar
is expected to remain in intervention, it added.

    The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and
other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure
on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of
crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of
polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.
    World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in
1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01
billion from 42.72 billion.
    Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion
marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.
    The statement made no mention of net profit figures.
Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.
    In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the
cold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues
at present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the
previous year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from
1986, Hoechst said.
    Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information
technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.
    Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of
the parent company, other units in West Germany, and to

restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.
    Roussel Uclaf <RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidated
partners did not perform as well as in 1985.
    Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax
profits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings
from interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall in
extraordinary costs.
    The fall in raw material prices was not enough to
compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and
currencies, Hoechst said.

of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled
by Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers in
eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved
in some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that
about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are
outstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the
International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of
Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association
has no comment and will study the proposals.
    ""What they are proposing is really double counting,"" Patrick
de Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley
and Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be
required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct
per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of
replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.
    ""The potential risk factors are very large relative to what
we had expected,"" said a director at one U.K. merchant bank.
""What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now --
to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might
have 10 years from now,"" he added.(Adds title first paragraph).
    Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by
the agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a
competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the
costs on to customers.
    Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the
exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal
Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the
proposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that
Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new
capital rules.
     Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank
regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is,
offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single
counterparty against each other.
    The paper said that regulatory authorities ""recognize that
such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce
credit risk."" Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting
agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it
might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.
    But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an
airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.
     ""One problem is that there has never been a major default
in the swaps market. So we don't know if any of the swap
arrangements will really stand up in court,"" said one bank
official.

national crisis in liability insurance eased during the past
year as the insurance industry's profits more than doubled to
11.5 billion dlrs, but some problems still persist.
    An administration working group, in an update of its report
a year ago, found that insurance premiums generally have
stabilized, but at high levels, as the crisis has abated.
    After severe financial difficulties in 1984 and 1985, the
insurance industry's rate of return last year recovered to the
same level as the performace of U.S. corporations in general,
the group said in a 98-page study.
    While the crisis has eased, the study found that liability
insurance will likely remain expensive and continue to be
difficult to obtain for some lines of coverage and for some
sectors of the American economy.
    Some types of insurance, especially associated with
environmental liability, remain unavailable for many companies
at any price, it said.
    The increased availability and the price stability for
insurance the past year has been accompanied by higher
deductibles, lower coverage limits and additional policy
restrictions, the study said.

recommendations aimed at dealing with the crisis, including 
limits on punitive damages and awards for pain, suffering and

1066,"The Bundesbank is planning changes in
the system by which banks bid for funds in securities
repurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key open
market instrument, central bank officials said.
    Banking economists said the changes will shorten the tender
process to two days from three currently, enabling the
Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if it
chooses, to steer money market liquidity more flexibly.
    The changes will probably come into force in April.
    Under the current system, banks must themselves specify at
the tender which securities they will sell to the Bundesbank
for subsequent repurchase, a time consuming business.
    Banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custody
accounts in the Landeszentralbank (LZB) regional central banks,
which are the local offices of the Bundesbank at state level.
    Some 50 billion marks of securities are held in such
accounts at the Hesse LZB, which covers the Frankfurt area.
    The change to come into force next month will allow the
Bundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself,
in a process legally comparable to direct debiting.
    At present the Bundesbank generally announces a tender on
Monday, holds the tender late on Tuesday morning, announces the
result early Tuesday afternoon and allocates funds Wednesday.
    The Bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running 28
days. But sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts or
longer tender periods being necessary.
    For instance the Bundesbank announced a tender last Friday
to be held today (Wednesday) for crediting funds tomorrow
(Thursday). The advance announcement took into account the
carnival holiday in Duesseldorf on Monday and in Frankfurt
yesterday (Tuesday).
    Central bank officials and money market dealers said the
shortening of the tender process should be seen as purely
technical, with no direct implications for interest rates.
    ""It is not a credit policy matter but a technical matter,""
said an official at the Hesse LZB.
    Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said last December
that security repurchase pacts had proved a much greater
success since their introduction in their present form two
years ago, and praised their flexibility.
    The tender process changes will make the repurchase pact
instrument even more flexible, banking economists said.
    By speeding up the tender process, they will make it
possible for the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts for
periods of less than a month, something long sought by banks,
to respond to changing money market conditions.

    Regularly heavy trading of more than one billion shares a

775.9 from 577.2 points in just over three weeks.
    Brokers described recent trading as ""frantic"" and ""hectic"" as
trading records were smashed day after day.
    A total 2.6 billion shares worth 259.4 million pesos
changed hands on the main Manila and the less important Makati
exchanges yesterday, with much of the activity among centavo
priced stocks, brokers said. The turnover was more than double
the record of 1.1 billion shares worth 118.1 million pesos set
on Wednesday.
    Brokers said rising gold prices caused mining shares to
shoot up three weeks ago, and other sectors followed. Share
prices continued their rise even when the gold price fell back
to 450 dlrs an ounce, due to rising confidence in President
Corazon Aquino's handling of the economy, they said.
    Brokers said Aquino's handling of the 18-year-old communist
insurgency and the maintenance of relatively low interest rates
also contributed to the rise.
    Blue chip stocks, such as those of San Miguel Corp and
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT), have risen 25 pct
in three weeks, and the trend is upward in the medium term
although a temporary correction is overdue, they said.
    Since the surge began on May 26, Manila's Mining index has

industrial index has shot up to 881.0 from 694.9 points, and
the oils indicator has increased to 4.1 from 2.9 points.

22 of them.
    Sy said Philippine stocks were undervalued in world terms
with price-earnings ratios often half those in Hong Kong and
one-sixth those in Japan. He said PLDT, which is also U.S.
Listed, has a price-earnings ratio of about nine.
    Sy predicted Manila's composite index would rise beyond
1,000 points from its current 775.9 mark by year-end.
    Other brokers were more cautious, saying Aquino had to
improve peace and order before investors could treat the
Philippines as they would Hong Kong or Tokyo.

into stocks was now foreign, much of it from fund managers and
their agents based in Hong Kong and New York.

NV Veghel (CHV), has begun legal proceedings against the
application of the European Community grain co-responsibility
levy, with the full backing of the Dutch animal grain and feed
trade association, Het Comite, association chief executive
Peter Pex told Reuters.
    Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and the
court said it would give its verdict within six weeks. ""However,
that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court to
refer questions on the interpretation and application of the
levy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg,"" Pex added.
    Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not take
account of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean a
compounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy in
its own national currency than it received down the chain from
the original producer of the grain.
    ""We would like the Business Administration Court in the
Hague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whether
the Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency,
has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but also
whether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,""
Pex said.
    ""It is only with great regret that we have taken this route,
but we have had no political help, and therefore have no option
even though it could take years,"" Pex added.
    Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against the
grain levy because the bill the company received from the
commodity board included grain from a wide variety of origins
and was therefore considered to be the best general basis for a
legal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.
    Het Comite's actions will run in tandem with questions on
the levy already posed to the Luxembourg Court in a case

approval from Federal court to sue the Internal Revenue Service
to determine if the IRS was correct in allowing the Conrad
Hilton Foundation to hold certain stocks.
    That ruling by the IRS allowed the Foundation, set up by
the late Conrad Hilton, to hold onto 27 pct of the Hilton Corp,
worth approximately 164 mln dlrs, according to Hilton
attorneys.
    Barron Hilton, Conrad's son, is making a bid to purchase
those 6,782,000 shares, the company said.
    However, in an effort to hold onto the stock, the
Foundation changed its tax status from a private foundation to
a public support organization, freeing it from the constraints
of the excess business holdings limitations imposed on private
foundations by the Tax Reform Act of 1969, according to the
Hilton Corp.
    That act said that a private foundation could not own more
than 20 pct of a corporation, lawyers explained. Anything over
that figure had to be sold.
    The lawyers explained that when Conrad Hilton died, the law
required that excess holdings by the Foundation above 20 pct of
the common stock should be sold. Under Conrad Hilton's will,
Barron had the option to buy the seven pct,  according to the
Hilton lawyers.

1085,"European Community (EC) leaders hope
to make a new attempt to inject fresh urgency into talks on
reforming the bloc's controversial farm policy when EC
agriculture ministers meet for a third day of discussions here
this morning.
    Community officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen
met Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker late last night to
plan a new initiative.
    Both Andriessen and de Keersmaeker, who currently chairs EC
farm ministers' meetings, were said to be disappointed by the
lack of progress in the talks so far this week.
    The bloc's executive Commission has proposed a tough
package involving effective cuts of upwards of 10 pct in
farmers' returns for many crops this year.
    Ministers were due to have adopted a package by April 1 but
are only this week getting down to serious negotiations.
    Yesterday, they discussed plans to cut cereals prices by
2.5 pct, and reduce farmers' rights to sell surpluses to EC
stores, to cut prices for fruit and vegetables by larger
margins, and to impose a tax on EC-produced and imported
oilseeds, a proposal which would be likely to sour EC trade
relations with the United States.
    Diplomatic sources said ministers, all of whom are opposed
to at least one of these propositions, maintained entrenched
positions yesterday, making the task of de Keersmaeker in
steering his colleagues towards a compromise a daunting one.
    They said he could also be treading a minefield if he
sought to breach the divide between his fellow ministers over
plans to change the system by which EC farm prices, expressed
in a notional common currency, are translated into the
currencies of member states.
    West German minister Ignaz Kiechle indicated yesterday he
would veto the adoption of Commission proposals in this area,
saying they would unfairly affect farmers in strong currency
nations.
    The Belgian sources said de Keersmaeker may today present a
paper to his colleagues which, while not having the status of a
compromise proposal, would attempt to narrow their options.
    But diplomats said the philosophical gap between ministers
like Kiechle, with his commitment to maintaining traditional
rural patterns, and others who see runaway farm spending as
unacceptable economically, is likely to prove extremely
difficult to bridge.
    They agreed with EC farmers' union association president
Hans Kjeldsen who said yesterday that an agreement in June
appeared to be the best that could be hoped for.

which introduced a new menu.
    Pillsbury also reported lower profits at Distron, Burger

quarter.
    A turnaround in grain merchandising was a major factor in
profit improvement for the nine months, Pillsbury said.
    Pillsbury said corporate expense showed a 4.3 mln dlr
profit in the quarter reflecting a 10.5 mln dlr gain on the
sale of a joint interest in an Australian food company and
lower corporate expenses, largely as a result of an early

O'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunction
blocking the planned merger of Delta <DAL> Airlines
Inc and Western Airlines <WAL>, the Court said.
    O'Connor's action came hours after a three-judge panel of
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had
blocked the merger until a dispute over union representation
had been settled by arbitration.
    A Supreme Court spokesman said O'Connor granted a stay of
the injuction, allowing the merger, worth nearly 860 mln dlrs,
to go through as planned later today.
    The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Each
of the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a
particular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to
provisionally overturn its rulings without comment.
    The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials of
Atlanta-based Delta, which had been preparing for the merger
for months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanes
belonging to Western, which has headquartera in Los Angeles.
    ""Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight,""
Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution late
last night. ""There was really very little that remained to be
done.""
    The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had been
filed in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air Transport
Employees union sought to force Western's management to fulfill
a promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger took
place.
    The airlines argued that Western's promise could not be
enforced in a takeover by a larger company.
    After learning of the appeals court ruling, Delta officials
last night spread the word by telephone that Western employees
should report for work today in their old uniforms, not in new
Delta outfits.
    Delta announced last September that it was purchasing
Western. The merger took place in December, and Western has
been operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Western
name was to have disappeared at midnight last night.
    At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to
represent Western employees after the integration of the two
airlines.
    While all but eight pct of Western's 11,000 employees are
unionized, only Delta's pilots are union members.
    Delta had maintained that the three unions having contracts

    Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by
partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.
    A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week
requesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses
such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying
Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.
    Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for
beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would
like to buy much more beef than currently allowed.
    He cited the example of a California company which
transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to
circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than
the value of the animal, he said.
    U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion
Corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow
from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986
quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan
has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.
    Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to
eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by
April, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually
be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because
liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese
mandarin orange industry.
    The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because
imports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And
Japanese officials have said.
   Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy
surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,
but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.
   Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,
including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in
Geneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain
minor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.

make significant gains next week and may suffer a temporary
correction, brokers said.
    Dashed hopes of a further cut in Japan's 2.5 pct discount
rate cut and a growing conviction the dollar will remain firm
against the yen in the near-term has created a measure of
uncertainty over the market's future, brokers said.
    ""Everybody is just trying to think through things and see
exactly what is going on,"" said a broker at Sanyo Securities Co

    This uncertainty was spotlighted by violent swings in stock
prices over the last two days. Today the 225-share average

    ""People expect a correction next week. They don't care if
the market falls to 24,000,"" the Sanyo broker said. ""There is
always enough money waiting to get into the market to fill any
correction.""
    Tokyo stock prices owe a major part of their two-year bull
run to repeated cuts in the discount rate, which diverts money
from bank deposits to the stock market and cuts the cost of
borrowing, boosting domestic demand and imports.

to sell domestic-related issues and include a few more
exporters,"" said Prudential Bache Securities' Hank Sawa.
    Tokyo-based foreign exchange dealers predict the dollar is
unlikely to fall sharply in the near term, thus convincing

1123,"Morgan Guaranty Ltd, through a special
financing subsidiary, said it is issuing the first repackaging
of perpetual floating rate notes, consisting of a repackaging
of an outstanding WestPac Banking Corp security.
    Trading in perpetual floating rate notes, about 17 billion
dlrs of which are outstanding, has come to a virtual halt as
prices plunged. Because the securities never mature, there is
no way to price them properly unless there is a liquid two-way
market for them.
    Investors have been stuck with billions of dollars of notes
on their books that no one else will buy.
    Under terms of the offer, Morgan said it has set up a
special-purpose financing company, Pacific Securities Co Ltd,
which will issue two separate securities. The unit becomes the
holder of 200 mln dlrs of Westpac floating rate notes.
    Morgan officials declined to disclose the level at which
Pacific  purchased the Westpac securities, although in late
February, they were quoted at 85 against an issue price of par.
    Pacific Securities will issue two instruments. The first is
a floating rate bond due March 29, 2002. The bond pays interest
at 50 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate.
    While the initial Westpac issue offered investors only 15
basis points over LIBOR, Morgan Guaranty said WestPac has
agreed with Pacific Securities that it will pay investors the
remaining 35 basis points.
    Also, WestPac has agreed to redeem to floating rate notes
after 15 years.
    The other portion of the security consists of a zero-coupon
bond, also maturing at 2002, for which the investor pays 20
cents on the dollar. Morgan officials said that by 2002, the
effective yield will be a 20 pct return.
    However, Morgan officials said, holders of the zero-coupon
bonds will not be paid in cash when the securities mature.
    Instead, they will be paid in an equivalent amount of
zero-coupon Westpac perpetual floating rate notes.
    As part of the agreement, Pacific Securities has agreed to
place proceeds of the sale of the new securities on deposit at
WestPac and earnings from the deposit will be used to subsidise
the payment of the additional interest to investors.
    Also as part of the issue, there is an option for issuance
of a 70 mln dlr tap to be offered the following year.
    The tap will consist of 70 mln dlrs in floating rate notes
paying and an additional equivalent amount of zero coupon bonds
also at a deep discount of 20 cents on the dollar.
    Fees consist of a one pct selling concession and 0.50 pct
combined underwriting and management.

tranches and two small syndicates are being formed, Morgan

1139,"The Swiss National Bank will continue to
take part in concerted intervention on currency markets as
necessary, president Pierre Languetin told the bank's annual
meeting.
    He said the dollar had on occasion hit highs or lows which
bore no relation to economic fundamentals and cooperation
between all monetary authorities was necessary to prevent it
breaching thresholds that would damage everyone.
    ""We are resolved -- as we have done in the past -- to take
part in concerted intervention to the extent that this is
possible and desirable,"" Languetin said.
    Languetin said Switzerland had noted with satisfaction the
six nation Paris accord on currency stabilisation measures in
February, adding that it had anchored the principle of
strengthened international cooperation.
    He said measures such as recent concerted intervention were
useful in the short term.
    But he added, ""The (Paris) Louvre accord can produce no
lasting effects without a correction of the fundamental
imbalances, without a reduction of the American budget deficit
and without stronger growth in Europe and Japan.""
    Languetin said certain changes would probably be necessary
in the ""too expansive"" monetary policy of the United States,
adding that there was a prevailing view that U.S. Money supply
was expanding too strongly.
    ""If this should last long the dollar could only be
stabilised at the cost of a substantial easing in monetary
policy on the part of the other central banks, which would in
turn create the basis for a new wave of world-wide inflation,""
he said. One positive factor was that monetary authorities in
the most important countries had not relinquished their
anti-inflation policies.

1140,"Bank of Montreal <BMO.M> Chairman
William Mulholland said he was reasonably optimistic that debt
negotiations between Brazil and its commercial bank creditors
can be accomplished satisfactorily in the long run.
    ""It's going to be a bit rocky short term ... a couple of
months ... but I am reasonably optimistic longer term,"" he told
a press briefing here.
    Earlier, Mulholland announced that Bank of Montreal has
formally applied to swap up to 100 mln dlrs of its roughly one
billion dlr cross border exposure to Brazil into local equity
investments under a novel conversion scheme.
    Tensions have been running high between Brazil and its bank
creditors since President Jose Sarney imposed a unilateral
suspension of interest payments on some 68 billion dlrs of
commercial bank debt on February 20, bankers said.
    Only yesterday, three leading U.S. banks voluntarily put
their Brazilian loans on non-accrual status and took a hefty
cut in net income for the first quarter ended March 31.
    Bankers saw this as a clear refusal to be intimidated into
granting major concessions as forthcoming refinancing talks.
    Bank of Montreal's Mulholland regretted Brazil's action but
declined to discuss what action his bank might take.
    Mulholland merely said that Bank of Montreal had not
canceled any of its short-term credit lines that came up for
renewal on March 31.
    However, John Bradlow, senior vice president of the
corporate and goverment banking division, said that it was
possible that Bank of Montreal might follow the U.S. banks'
lead in its second quarter results accounting.
    ""A decision will be made at April 30 or in the first weeks
of May,"" he told reporters after the briefing. Unlike most
major U.S. banks, whose reporting year ends on December 31,
Canadian banks operate on a November through October basis.
    At the press briefing, Mulholland detailed the proposed
debt/equity conversion scheme, which is aimed at boosting
investment capital and conserving foreign exchange reserves.
    Unlike many existing programs, Bank of Montreal intends to
sell its own dollar-denominated debt at par to either the
obligor or local investors for cruzados, which would then be
ploughed into Brazilian assets.
    Mulholland said current debt/equity schemes, in which bank
debt is often sold to foreign third parties at a discount, were
like ""peddling off debt at fire sale prices"". He added that
they could do pyschological harm to investor confidence.
    While acknowledging that Brazil has yet to give its
official blessing to the plan, Mulholland predicted, ""if it is
supported, we are going to see more of this.""
    Sources at other large banks with sizeable exposure to
Brazil were not so sure about the scheme's success.
    ""I don't think it's going to fly because of the impact it
would have on money supply and other political reasons,"" said
one banker, noting that earlier informal proposals along the
same lines received ""fairly neutral responses.""
    ""And is there a market for such investment in a time of
great uncertainty,"" he added.
    Mulholland admitted, ""it is something of an experiment....
some one has to screw up the courage and do something.""
    ""It is very important that avenues (to reversing net
capital outflows) are broadened,"" he added, noting that in
recent years the options have in fact been narrowing.
    Another senior banker agreed that debt/equity swap
proposals, such as Bank of Montreal's, should be explored and
developed but warned that Brasilia has been ""very ambivalent""
about debt/equity schemes thus far.
    The banker added, ""debt/equity conversion should happen but
it is not a major instrument for solving debt problems.""

profit for the full year of about 150 mln dlrs.

outstanding.

exposure of about 1.8 billion dlrs. The company's total loan

said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach
the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.
    The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than
those of the other four leading German institutes, said the
economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its
prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.
    The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national
product (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in
real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter
of last year. 
    The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in the
remaining three quarters, it was unlikely that demand and
production would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to
1.5 pct.
    Other institutes and economists have recently revised their
forecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct.
    In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists that
the economy was showing mixed development, with domestic demand
healthy but foreign demand weak.
    DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand for
capital goods, and strong demand for buildings and consumer
goods, not between foreign and domestic demand.
    It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had been
hit in recent months by the weakness of exports, which had
caused West German firms to scale back investment plans.
    Service industries, unlike manufacturing industry, were
continuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand,
it said.
    In a separate report the HWWA economic research institute
in Hamburg said West Germany's real trade surplus would fall
markedly this year.
    However, the nominal trade surplus would show little change
from 1986's record 112.2 billion marks because of a further
improvement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 compared

world oil prices and reduced interest rates, it said.

    Electric power firms and gas companies are likely to see
42.5 and 31.6 pct falls in current profits respectively in
1987/88 due to cuts in utility prices to recycle windfall
profits made during the yen's rise against the dollar, and due

rates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are divided
over the issue.
    Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse und

percentage point in interest rates across the board. But Hannes
Androsch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> told
Reuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers.
    Vak told a news conference that last January's cut in
lending rates for commercial customers and for all depositors
by a quarter point had been insufficient.
    The January cut followed the National Bank's lowering of
its discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with a
similar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct and
deposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct.
    Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche
Zentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of a
point, or even half a point if German rates dropped further.
    Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. A
widening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West German
credit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth
this year also justified a further interest drop, he said.
    Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank der
oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called for
lower deposit rates but said lending rates should remain
unchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small,
particularly when compared with other West European countries.
    But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste Oesterreichische
Spar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unless

1192,"<Shell U.K. Ltd's> pre-tax profit on
exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in
1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices
last year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said.
    But he told a press conference that due to the high
marginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact of
the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330
mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985.
    The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, with
Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, he
said.
    As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration and
production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln.
    Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell
Group <RD.AS>, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg,
up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against
8.81 mln.
    Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company's crude oil
output from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986,
which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the
company. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the
current year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the decline
in output from the major Brent field, he said.
    Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas
liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to
be maintained in 1987, he said.
    A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey
North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months,
Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5
billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil
price fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.
    Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North
Sea fields, which were approved last year, have brought the
cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.
    Day to day operating costs of the exploration and
production sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the target
is to keep costs per barrel constant.
    The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading to
the discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early to
gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.
    Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a
profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.
    Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit <Shell
U.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987
were a ""bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.""
    In November and December in particular, refining operations
had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil
product prices, he said. He expected margins to continue
generally positive over the summer, although they could dip to
become negative from time to time, depending on price
movements.
    A new catalytic cracker at Shell's Stanlow refinery will
now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about five
months behind schedule, following a crane accident which
severely damaged the plant last year, he said.
    Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from
11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical
site.
    Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by which
companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying
development expenditure on certain future oil fields against
PRT, was ""helpful,"" but rather less than had been hoped for.
    Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in
the range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, he
would expect some over-production above OPEC""s official 15.8 mln
bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.
    He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain
output was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance,
but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will
fall.

intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln
dlr bond offering.
    A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unit

investigators and was cooperating with the probe.

a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a
cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the
prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a
Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the
magazine.
    Among interleukin's principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp
<CTUS>, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp
<IMNX>, based in Seattle, Wash.
    The journal, to be released late today, contains two
articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types.
    The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding
that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search
for a successful immunotherapy for cancer.
    Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally
produced by living cells in the laboratory.
    The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as
a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its
effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year
later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its
ravaging side effects.
    One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of
Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly
significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after
it changed the way in which the drug is administered.
    In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer
patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers
and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin
cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities' Stuart
Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine.
    For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no
remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side
effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital
care, according to the article.
    In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven
Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers
administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct
remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in
melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum.
    In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four
patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness
of the drug's side effects as originally administered.
    ""Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search
for successful immunotherapy for cancer,"" said the editorial,
signed by John Durant of Philadelphia's Chase Cancer Center.
    ""These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely
did not describe successful practical approaches ready for
widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients,"" the
editorial said.
    ""On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a
successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we
may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in

May/September temporao harvest in Brazil's main cocoa growing
state of Bahia are now in the 1.5 mln to 2.0 mln 60-kilo bag
range against 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln two weeks ago.
    Traders in the state capital Salvador told Reuters the
effects of a dry period in the first six weeks of the year had
been harsher than thought earlier.
    Although good flowering had followed the onset of rains in
mid-February subsequent pod setting was dissappointing.
    Last year's temporao, also hit by a dry spell, was 2.77 mln
bags. In 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 1.79 mln bags.
    The traders said another factor leading to lower crop
predictions is that many farmers are not caring properly for
plantations because of low returns on their investment.
    Manpower, fertiliser and other costs have been cut back as
farmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over the
past six months coupled with low bean prices.
    If such economies continue into the winter months both the
temporao and the developing October/April main crop could face
serious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which would
normally be treated against the disease.
    Recent very wet weather has already caused some isolated
incidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions say
these are not yet significant.
    The traders said they expect very low deliveries of
temporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and the
bulk will not appear until the last month, September.
    Despite the low loads, trees are said to be in excellent
condition and recent flowering and pod setting - which will
lead to late temporao/early main crop beans - has been good.

1214,"After an already steep fall in the past
week, U.S. interest rate futures may be in for further declines
in the near term, financial analysts said.
    However, some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond
futures have left the bond market somewhat oversold, and the
contracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery before
resuming their decline.
    Key to the near-term direction of futures will be the
course of the dollar, they said.
    ""As the dollar goes, so goes the bond market,"" said Dean
Witter analyst Karen Gibbs.
    The recent decline in the dollar, which hit a 40-year low
against the Japanese yen Monday, was reversed Wednesday when
several large U.S. money center banks unexpectedly raised their
prime lending rates by a quarter point, to 7-3/4 pct.
    ""Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar,
foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline
is over,"" Gibbs said.
    The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt
futures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation.
    Indeed, the falling dollar may have been a key topic at the
meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy making arm, the Federal
Open Market Committee, this week, analysts said.
    ""To the Fed, the combination of a falling dollar, a
steepening yield curve, and rising commodity prices look
suspiciously like the traces of expectations of accelerating
inflation,"" said Denis Karnosky, analyst at Carroll, McEntee
and McGinley Inc.
    Such expectations could mean that ""a shift in policy toward
restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious
consideration,"" at the FOMC meeting, he said.
    Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highly
visible form of monetary tightening, Karnosky said.
    Rather, the key to detecting a change will be found in
seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window, he
said. Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mln
dlrs over the past several months, he said.
    In the meantime, however, ""the market looks a bit
oversold,"" said Jim Wysoglad, analyst at Golden Gate Futures.
    Wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition could
drive June bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to test
chart support near the recent low of 97-13/32.
    Technician Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston
said that the key test for June bonds will be whether the
nearby contract holds above chart support at 96-24/32.
    ""All previous selloffs since mid-November have stopped and
buyers have surfaced at that level,"" Keefe said.
    If that level is broken, and the dollar continues to
decline, Keefe said she expects the June bond contract to
decline to test support between 92 and 93, the primary uptrend
line dating back to 1984.

1215,"Since British Airways was sold to the
public by the British government, airline analysts have begun
covering the big carrier and giving it good reviews.
    ""Analysts are picking up British Airways because it's a
major airline, and because they have fewer companies to work
with after all the mergers,"" said Merrill Lynch analyst Edmund
Greenslet. ""Two years ago there were enough U.S. carriers, but
now more analysts are adding the international airlines.""
    Merrill Lynch, for instance, will be covering it from its
international offices, he said.
    British Airways was sold to the public by the Conservative
government in February.
    It has a fleet of 167 jetliners, making it the largest in
Europe. A relatively small portion of revenue and traffic comes
from intra-U.K. operations, and its predominantly long-haul
route network spans the globe.
    Julius Maldutis at Salomon Brothers said he likes British
Airways because it can quickly redeploy jets to strong markets
or away from weak ones, as it did last year in response to the
severe downturn in North Atlantic traffic after the Chernobyl
nuclear disaster and terrorist actions.
    ""Because of its diverse network, it has the ability to
hedge or mitigate adverse developments in one particular area,""
Maldutis said.
    He said British Airways should outperform the rest of the
stock market. Salomon was an underwriter for the company's
public offering in February.
    About 6.3 mln British Airways' American depositary receipts
are traded on the NYSE, and 2.8 mln ADRs on the Toronto
exchange. Each ADR equals 10 ordinary shares.
    Louis Marckesano at Janney Montgomery Scott said British
Airways near-term outlook is good. ""We're looking for good
traffic growth and improved revenues,"" he said.
    ""British Airways should be riding a good wave,"" he said.
""Its fiscal year began April one, so when you think of all the
troubles it experienced in the first half of last year,
especially in the North Atlantic market, you know all
camparisons should be nice.""
    At March 31 the carrier had total debt of 279 mln stg for a
debt-to-equity ratio of 33 pct, which is very good for an
airline, analysts said.
    ""Its balance sheet is very conservative - perhaps too
conservative for an airline - but that means it can borrow to
expand its fleet,"" Marckesano said.
    British Airways has been a leading force of airline
liberalization in Europe, which is being gradually implemented
to avoid the problems of U.S. airline deregulation, which
brought years of unstable fares and losses.
    Analysts agree a phased-in deregulation will greatly
benefit British Airways over the long run because it is the
largest European carrier.
    Analysts caution that British Airways faces increasing
competition for travelers to Europe from U.S. carriers as
airline consolidation here expands route networks.
    In 1983, for instance, about 69 pct of U.K.-bound
passengers transferred to European carriers after arriving at
U.S. gateway airports onboard U.S. carriers.
    But U.S. carriers are retaining more of their passengers,
and this year about 30 pct of U.K.-bound travelers are expected
to switch to a European carrier to complete the trip, according
to British Airways' chief executive officer, Colin Marshall.
    ""British Airways had a greater shot at picking up traffic
when it was funneled to New York,"" said Marckesano ""Now,
traffic is being captured earlier by U.S. carriers as it leaves
Atlanta, Dallas and other cities,"" said Marckesano.
    He also said that British Airways' first-half results might
mislead an investor into gauging full-year results because its
fiscal year begins April one.
    ""Profits build in the first half. But if an investor just
doubles that figure, he'll be making a big mistake,"" he said.

it no longer wished to make two-way prices at all times in

euroyen bond traders have been in a meeting and unavailable to
make prices. Market sources said that Salomon had offered the
traders a chance to remain with the firm if they were willing
to trade eurobonds denominated in other currencies.
    Dealers noted that at one point this year, euroyen bond
issuance had actually outpaced that of eurodollar denominated
bonds, the first time the U.S. Unit has been eclipsed as the
currency of choice for international borrowers.
    Dealers said that given the dollar's recent weakness, the

    The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure

by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S.

export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in

1223,"Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's
central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are
normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the
central bank's independence.
    But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,
president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a
controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of
the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.
    Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last
Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and
interest rates
    Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's
criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place
for foreign investors.
    ""The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and
Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign
investors,"" said one economist for a London broker, who asked
not to be identified.
    Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial
policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to
steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.
    ""There are plenty of objective pressures which will result
in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill
feeling,"" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.
    News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct
withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in
a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and
abroad.
    Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the
finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the
Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting
details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.
    Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under
extraordinary pressures lately.
    Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his
deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight
inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had
pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.
    In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like
Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been
warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply
growth would eventually lead to rising prices.
    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank
council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his
views, bankers said.
    ""Poehl is in a minority in his own house,"" said Commerzbank's
Pfister.
    ""Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not
entirely his own,"" said another economist.
    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,
they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark
and hurting West German exporters.
    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the
Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.
    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James
Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.
    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986
war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.
Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to
stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.
    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round
of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.
    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for
Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.
    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted
most popular government politician last year, had to face
resistance from local barons in the government coalition
parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.
    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising
4.3 billion marks.
    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will
push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the
government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.
    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row
which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.
    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last
month early to sort out a row in the northern state of
Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.
    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after
allegations of a ""dirty tricks"" election campaign led to heavy
losses for the CDU in state elections.
    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last
weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.
    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more
remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and
was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this
year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government
gave Poehl another eight-year term.
    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he
hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.
    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was
not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the
Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.

the few bright spots in the international oilpatch with about
1,000 rigs currently working and annual increases of 80-100
expected through the end of the century, a Chinese petroleum
official said.
    ""In China, production concentrates on the domestic market,
and does not depend on the international price of oil,"" Zhai
Guang Ming, a director of the Chinese Ministry of Petroleum,
told Reuters.
    Chinese oil sold within the nation's borders is priced at
about one-third the 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price established
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Zhai said
in an interview at the World Petroleum Congress.
    The optimism in China is in sharp contrast to the United
States where weak oil prices have prompted a steep fall in the
number of active rigs from a 1981 peak of 4,500 to only 765
last week according to the latest Baker Hughes Co rig count.
    At this time, China actually has more rigs in operation
than any other country in the world, said Xianglin Hou, another
member of the 20-man Chinese delegation at the Houston meeting.
    But this does not mean good news for the sagging oilfield
equipment industry in the rest of the world, said Bryan Walman,
international sales manager for Reed Tool Co in Houston.
    Walman said more than 90 pct of China's drilling activity
is on land and under the control of the Chinese government
which requires local manufacture of drilling equipment.
    But U.S. and other western nations do provide equipment for
China's fledgling offshore projects as well as participate in
the actual drilling, he said.
    Amoco Corp <AN>, for example, has reported a discovery in
1,000 feet of water in the South China Sea.
    ""We're encouraged,"" said Alfred Munk, manager of Amoco's
foreign affairs, ""but we need substantial reserves before we
can do commercial production in a remote area like that.""
     Zhai estimated that current Chinese oil production of 130
mln tonnes a year should rise to total 200 mln tonnes annually
by the year 2,000.
    Chinese crude reserves total 23.6 billion barrels, with
ultimate resources estimated at 69.3 billion barrels.

    The United States has been working closely with allies and
friends in Europe and Asia to develop a proposed treaty on
reducing these weapons with an eye to their eventual
elimination, the president said.
     He said the treaty draft followed the formula he agreed
upon with Gorbachev at their summit meeting last October in
Reykjavik, Iceland, which was shelved when the Soviet leader
insisted on linking approval of such a pact to agreement on
long-range strategic missiles and anti-missile defense.
    ""I remain firmly committed to these objectives,"" he said.
    He said Gorbachev's new offer Saturday ending the linkage
of the three areas of negotiations removed a major barrier to
agreement and was consistent with the Soviet position at the
earlier Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Geneva in November 1985.

1228,"French industry is failing to produce the
goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left
the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the
economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development said.
    With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct
this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb
to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9
pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.
    The report said the French economy was ""increasingly
ill-adapted to demand"" selling goods at ""uncompetitive relative
prices on both domestic and export markets.""
    ""France's poor export performance reflects a geographical
bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average...
And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18
months,"" it said.
    Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit
to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986,
it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the
franc could lead to ""a (renewed) loss of competitiveness
relative not only to the United States but also to the newly
industrialised countries.""
    This could result in further major losses of market share,
particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a
quarter of French exports, it said.
    Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the
authorities would have ""little scope for macroeconomic
manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to
encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow
more briskly,"" it added.
    But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage
demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a
two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.
    Written mainly in December last year, the report took no
account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct
surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the
government's deregulation of service sector tariffs.
    ""We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke
runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has
been lost,"" one OECD official commented.
    OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil
prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the
report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast
to around 2.5 or three pct.
    The government last week revised its forecast up to between
2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct.
    But the OECD backed the government's view that the
underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year,
with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's
fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of
disinflation.
    With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in
the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and
its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one
pct this year, it said.
    On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for
industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply
as companies built up their profits.
    ""For the disinflationary process to continue , and price
competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange
rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,""
it said.

elected by the copper workers union for the first time since
the left-wing government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in
a 1973 coup.
     Nicanor Araya, a member of the Popular Democratic Movement
(MDP), was named president of the Chilean Confederation of
Copperworkers (CTC), which groups 22,000 workers employed in
the state-owned copper mines, union officials said.
    Other members of the MDP, which includes the communist
party and a faction of the socialist party, took five of the
principal positions on the union's directorate.
    The state-owned copper company of Chile (CODELCO) produces
around 90 pct of the country's copper output of some one mln
tonnes per year. Chile is the world's leading copper exporter
and sales account for just under 50 pct of its export income.
    The MDP won six out of the 14 places on the union's
directorate in elections earlier this month, with the christian
democratic party holding five and the remainder being won by
independents.
    But the left-wing was left in control of the union after
the christian democrats and independents failed to reach
agreement on a joint candidate for the presidency and withdrew
from negotiations.
    Union elections were called following the resignation of
former president Rodolfo Seguel last October.
    Seguel, a christian democrat and Chile's best-known union
leader, said he was forced to step down after repeated court
actions brought by CODELCO prevented the union from operating.
    The labour leader, who now heads the inter-union national
workers command (CNT), was among 500 workers sacked by CODELCO
following a strike in 1983.
    The strike, the only copper industry stoppage staged in the
past 13 years, marked the start of a wave of protests against
the military rule of President Augusto Pinochet.
     CODELCO argued that Seguel could not continue as union
leader when no longer employed by the company.

1247,"The market in floating rate notes showed
no clear signs of recovery today from the confusion which sent
prices tumbling and paralysed trading at the end of last week,
dealers and bank officials said.
    FRN dealers said at least 10 houses did not open for
business with many market operators pausing to assess their
next steps in the wake of Friday's huge drops and panic
trading.
    Despite some late signs that prices were recovering last
week, today's erratic trade provided a similarly mixed final
picture with longer-dated FRNs still clearly under pressure.
    While FRN specialists noted that paper on which coupons are
shortly due to be refixed had managed to hold up today, as had
notes paying a relatively higher margin, longer term FRNs were
still subject to intense selling pressure.
    ""Anything longer than 10 years is still being sold off
seriously, as is just about any paper in the banking sector,""
one FRN market source at a leading U.S. House said.
    He noted that one long-dated Citicorp issue -- paper which
has suffered recently on fears over Latin American debt
exposure -- slipped by two points to around 94.00. FRNs, whose
coupons are refixed regularly, usually trade around par.
    U.S. And Canadian bank paper was still generally under
pressure, as was Republic of Ireland paper, due to renewed
worries about the Irish economic situation.
    The malaise was felt through the banking sector with a two
point fall registered by one BNP note, to give a three point
drop over two trading days.
    Retail clients, usually seen returning to the market as
price falls push yield margins up to these attractive levels,
have been unnerved by the last three days' panic, dealers said.
    ""Yes, there's been some bargain hunting, but no one dares to
be first to come seriously back in,"" said one dealer.
    ""A handful of market giants have frightened the retail away
with this aggressive manipulation. As true liquidity drains, we
are going to have to see some better market cooperation and
rationalisation,"" commented one FRN trader now dealing with
straight bond issues since the floater market crisis.
    This view was shared by the majority of FRN market sources
polled by Reuters since trade began to collapse last week.
    Of the 50 or so houses who have up until now made a market
in floaters, dealers estimated that around a dozen did not
quote FRN prices today and they reported that one or two houses
were not expected to resume trade in the securities at all.
    Many called meetings to assess the current market
situation.
    ""Given the potential volatility of this market -- one which
has been conclusively proved by the events of the last days --
senior management are now duty bound to revise the set of
parameters within which they, as market makers, are now to
work,"" commented one senior source at a leading U.K. Investment
house.
    However, there were no reports that a formal crisis meeting
of market makers -- such as that called in December last year
during the perpetual FRN market collapse -- was on the cards.
    Several firms were expected to cut back drastically on the
list of FRNs traded, with most volatile paper first to go.
    Elsewhere in the eurobond market, business was extremely
quiet, with virtually no activity seen in the dollar straight
sector which has been becalmed of late, traders said.
    ""There has been no real two-way business today, neither has
there been any new issues for diversion,"" noted one trader.
    ""All we have seen today is some squaring up of positions,""
she added. Investors remain cautious of the dollar, which
though recently stable, still has potential downside risk.
    Eurosterling, the market sector which, aside from the FRNs,
has been in the headlines lately, was quiet today ahead of the
U.K. Government budget due to be announced tomorrow.
    Undertone was very firm with dealers expecting a positive
fiscal package tomorrow and, if not more good economic news to
boost sterling, at least confirmation of the bull factors which
have bolstered eurosterling and gilt-edged bonds lately.
    ""It was just sit and wait today but I expect it will be full
steam ahead on Wednesday,"" commented one sterling market source.
    Prices showed gains to 1/8 to 3/8 point across the board.
    Dealers said several new eurosterling issues were currently
in the pipeline and an early issue is expected to be for a
major European bank which currently has a mandate in the
market.
    In other sectors, euroyen also maintained its firm tone.
    Although the market is expected to be resting until trading
switches to an April value date, the euroyen sector is expected
to be buoyed by some professional switching out of Japanese
government bonds into relatively cheaper euroyen bonds.
    Two new yen issues were features on an otherwise quiet

    Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumer

oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis
Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be
obliged to restore their positions.
    ""I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April,"" he
told a news conference here at his return from the failed

slide on the world markets continues.
    He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa

    Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based

    ""An initiative from IACO is likely very soon,"" he said
without elaborating.
    ""Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked
on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile
market,"" he said.
    Questioned by journalists, the minister said President
Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his
government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed
by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season.
    Last year, the West African nation announced that the
coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents)
per kilo.
    Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify
its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from
world market fluctuation.

grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln
tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.
    Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,
told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this
year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.
    He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in
harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage
problems.
    Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,
theoretically sufficient for the crop.
    But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly
distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do
Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were
responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.
    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West
growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage
capacity.
    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and
maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains
production but only 20 pct of its storage space.
    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,
there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to
storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for
storing loose grain, Brito said.
    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the
crops.
    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop
has been evident from television reports, which have shown
enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.

A senior economic planner said.

reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second
half of this year.
    Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and
Wang said further cuts would go much deeper.
    ""We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs
faster and more substantially,"" he said.
    The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has said
the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of
almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as
too selective.
     Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6
billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign
exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made
Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.

1281,"The USDA quarterly hogs and pig report
yesterday showed more hogs on U.S. farms compared to last year
as profitability resulting from low grain prices encouraged
producers to step up production, analysts said.
    Most analysts seemed to agree with Chicago Mercantile
Exchange floor traders that the report will be viewed as
bearish to pork futures and futures prices may open sharply
lower today. Some traders and analysts expect limit declines in
nearby contracts, with spillover selling likely in cattle.
    University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,""The
report shows that hog producers have responded to a very
desirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10
months.""
    Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futures
prices are above producers' break even points. Even if futures
fell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could still
lock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavy
selling pressure today.
    ""We have not had a period of profitability of this
magnitude since last summer,"" Levitt said. ""In fact, hog
operations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have been
so profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get back
on their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hog
operation alone.""
    Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also was
negative, in that some lead time was anticipated before the
slaughter increased from the previous year.
    We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but we
didn't expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-state
spring report, Levitt added.
    High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn that
could be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increased
profits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations to
increase production starting late last year.
    Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hog
herd resulted from a revision of the December report and
without the revision, the March report might have been very
close to average expectations.
    Robin Fuller of Agri Analysis said the USDA made a major
upward revision of 105,000 head in the size of the breeding
herd in the December 1 report. So the December report was more
bearish than initially indicated.
    But Fuller, as well as other analysts, expected the report
to be less negative on deferred futures contracts. Distant
contracts are already at a sharp discount to cash because
traders anticipated high farrowing intentions, she noted.
    Discounts in the October and December contracts take into
consideration a six to seven pct increase in March/May
farrowing intentions, which was borne out in the March 1
report, Fuller said.
    Grimes said, ""As far as the distant months are concerned,
if our first quarter pig crop is up only six pct and under 60
lb inventories actually up only five pct, it would take a
tremendous discount in price for each percent increase for us
to push down to the prices that the current futures show for
the July and August period.""
    Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for AGE Clearing noted that
distant futures prices are already 15 to 20 dlrs lower than
they were last summer.
    ""If cash hogs at the 7-markets last year averaged 61 dlrs

would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on

    Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness
of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and
Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.
    But he declined to say what measures would be discussed
ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later

the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre

trading partners.
    ""There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord,"" he

    Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a
""slight firming"" of the yen against the dollar.

since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell
marks to support the dollar.
    ""The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market,"" he

    Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the
bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be
accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.

pledges for economic stimulation.

what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit --
and get it through Congress,"" he added.

the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.

    The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previous
year and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank's share
capital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986
from 2.7 billion a year earlier.
    Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when
the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit
of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985.
    Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast.
    The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total rose
to 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion.
    General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment
would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last
year's better profits had resulted from improvements in
services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling
lending.
    Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate
margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when
compared with those in other countries, he said.
    Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and
abroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits,
Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure.
    Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had
fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations,
removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet
total.
    In an attempt to generate more foreign business,
representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong
Kong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to
abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and
drawing dividends.
    Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose
eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers

to finance a number of large-scale projects in the city
including an underground railway system, Mayor Jiang Zemin
said.
    Jiang told Reuters general manager Michael Nelson that he
hoped work on the railway system to ease Shanghai's transport
problems would start within two years.
    Other projects in this city of 12 mln people include a
bridge and an extra tunnel under the Huangpu river, a new
airport and passenger ship terminals and China's biggest
railway station, due to open at the end of this year.
    The mayor said foreign companies would be invited to
participate in some projects through international tendering.
    But he added that firms hoping to take part would have to
come up with package deals involving soft loan financing.
    ""This is a complex issue. The conditions relating to
tendering will have to be associated with conditions for
receiving soft loans,"" he said.
    He said the city was willing to use commercial loans to
finance technological improvements to factories which could
show a quick return in increased exports and foreign exchange
earnings.
    ""But infrastructure projects take much longer and involve
much bigger investments, and with them, the ideal way is to use
soft loans,"" he said.

already contacted the Shanghai authorities with proposals on
the underground railway project.

protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Has increased alarmingly

    ""It is a radically changed situation and is very explosive.
We are on the verge of some very harsh mandatory retaliatory
laws which would have very serious consequences for other

surpluses with the U.S., Trade analysts said.

Japan to begin negotiations on its rice policy and end import
quotas on beef and citrus.
    Lyng said he was disappointed Kato rejected the U.S.
Request but hoped it would not lead to a protectionist response
in Congress, where legislation on rice retaliation has been
introduced in both the House and Senate.
    Lyng said the U.S. Is dependent on Japan as a market for
exports because Japan has been the largest buyer of U.S. Farm
products since 1964, especially grains.
    He said the U.S. Understands Japan, with a limited land
area, is concerned about maintaining some level of

postponement of between 150,000 and 200,000 tonnes of Cuban raw

ministers, who earlier this week ended another marathon
negotiating session, achieved more than ever before in the
fight to end food surpluses, and delighted EC officials are now
preparing to carry the reform offensive into other areas.
    Their immediate aim is to drain the wine and olive oil
""lakes"" and level the ""grain mountain"" that have brought the
Community so much unwelcome publicity.
    Earlier this week, ministers finally agreed after 36 hours
of negotiations the fine details of an outline accord to cut
milk output by 9.5 pct over two years and reduce butter stocks,
now at a record 1.2 mln tonnes.
    Officials said new rules, which place strict limits on
farmers' rights to benefit from high subsidised prices, could
be expected to reduce sales into intervention to a trickle and
pave the way for reform in other surplus sectors.
    The deal was reached despite determined attempts at
backsliding by some states as the implications of the original
outline accord reached last December began to sink in.
    ""Despite coming under tremendous pressure, the ministers
never wavered from the main features of the deal,"" one senior
official said, adding the result augured well for talks later
this month on other reforms.
    The Commission is leading the fight against food surpluses
and has now proposed the most severe annual price review, at
which ministers fix farm support prices, in the EC's history.
    Most prices would be cut or frozen, new quality standards
enforced, and most farmers' rights to sell to intervention
curtailed. Officials say the measures could lead to effective
price cuts for some low quality cereals of eight to 11 pct.

them from the worst effects of a restrictive price policy and

1348,"European Community (EC) agriculture
ministers meet later today to consider a package of deep cuts
in prices and subsidies after a week marked by strong protests
by European farmers, Community officials said.
    The common target for the farmers' wrath is the EC's
Brussels Commission, which for the fourth year running has
called for radical changes in the price support system.
    EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen says huge food
surpluses, which have alienated international trade partners
and pushed the Community to the edge of bankruptcy, demand such
action.
    With Community warehouses stocked with some 16 mln tonnes
of unwanted cereals, over one mln tonnes of butter and huge
stocks of wine and olive oil, Andriessen says bluntly the days
of open-ended price guarantees must end.
    EC agriculture ministers try to fix the guaranteed prices
paid to Community farmers before an April 1 deadline for the
new marketing year, an increasingly difficult task as EC
members cut funds and demand greater budget discipline.
    Andriessen has proposed a freeze for most prices, coupled
with reductions in other support mechanisms, which could lead
to price cuts of as much as eight pct for some products.
    A producer's right to sell into EC warehouses at a fixed
guaranteed price when he finds no real market outlet is to be
scaled back so it applies only in exceptional cases.
    The latest proposals are designed to keep expenditure on
agriculture virtually stable. EC farm policies now swallow
two-thirds of an annual budget of about 36 billion European
currency units (Ecu) and are mainly responsible for an expected
shortfall this year of about five billion Ecus.
    The most contentious aspects of the package are a new oils
and fats tax and a change in the ""green"" exchange rate system,
which translates EC farm prices into national currencies.
    The tax, of up to 330 Ecus per tonne, would be levied on
imported and domestically produced oilseeds, but could trigger
a fresh trade dispute with the United States, which provides
the EC with the bulk of its soybeans.
    It would increase the cost of margarines and low-fat
products in an attempt to increase both olive oil and butter
consumption.
    West Germany has flatly rejected green rate changes, which
would cause a fall in prices for producers as countries with
weak and strong currencies were brought more into line.

half an hour early under a pile of unfilled orders on heavy,
but not record, volume of over 11 mln shares, Exchange
officials said.
    As traders remained on the floors in San Francisco and Los
Angeles, madly trying to balance their accounts long after the
close, Exchange Chairman Maurice Menn told a news conference
trading will, nevertheless, begin on time tomorrow,
at 0630 Pacific Daylight Time.
    Menn told reporters the price of a seat on the exchange
dropped to 86,000 dlrs today from 100,100 dlrs a week ago.
    Menn said the day also saw 134,000 options contracts
traded, compared to a record 202,000 contracts last friday.
    Traders both in Los Angeles and San Francisco said volume
was curbed purely by their inability to fill orders and the
chaos created by the exchange tape falling hours behind, making
it nearly impossible to get accurate price readings.
    ""If we would have been able to execute the orders we got,
there would have been 20 mln shares traded,"" said Richard
Goforth, a partner with Crowell Weedon and Co, who trades on
the Los Angles floor of the Pacific Exchange.

reports that one brokerage house alone turned away orders for
50,000 shares they were unable to fill in late trading.
    The traders and exchange officials said action on the
Pacific Exchange did not deviate from that in New York, with
some early buying giving way to panic selling through the
close, which left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down a
record 508 points.
    ""We pretty much mirrored what was going on in New York...
they couldn't fill their orders and we knew we couldn't fill
them either,"" said Goforth.
    While traders said they are bracing themselves for a lower
opening tomorrow, Mann attributed today's dive to panicking
young traders and to monetary policy and said the market should
still recover.
    ""It depends on what the politicians do...There's no reason
it cannot go back. This is an abnormality and there is no
justification for this. People are nervous,"" he said.

countries at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council
meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer
stock rules, delegates said.
    While consumers do not yet have a common position, an
observer said after a consumer meeting, ""They are much more
fluid ... and the tone is positive.""
    European Community consumers were split on the question of
how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met
in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into
effect, delegates said.
    At the January meeting, France sided with producers on how
the buffer stock should operate, delegates said. That meeting
ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules.
    The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether
the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their
differences at this month's meeting.
    The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an
informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among
producers on the key buffer stock issues, delegates said.
    The key issues to be addressed at this council session
which divide ICCO members are whether non-member cocoa should
be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price
differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types
of cocoa, delegates said.
    A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be
able to compromise on the non-member cocoa question.
    A working group comprising delegates from all producing and
consuming member countries met briefly this morning, then broke
up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting, followed by a
consumer meeting.
    Producers, who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a
variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non-member cocoa being
accepted, reviewed their position ahead of the working group
meeting this afternoon.
    ""We are waiting to see what consumers say,"" a producer
delegate said. ""We hope they will be flexible or it will be
difficult to negotiate.""
    The ICCO comprises 33 member countries. Non-
members include the U.S., a consumer, and Malaysia, an

subsidiary of Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fell
by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record
221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous
year.
    Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news
conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this
year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable
whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.
    He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last
year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified
amount from 1985's record levels.
    Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from
9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10
billion this year.
    Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the
parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi
would ensure VW got a share of profits.
    Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free
reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years
VW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend.
    Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output
caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on
currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About
alleged ""sudden acceleration"" of some of its Audi 5000 models.
    As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct
to 59,800 last year.
    Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom
out in 1987.
    Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.
    Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000,
but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180
in 1985.
    Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the
first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall
market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the
same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales
fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide
deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to
57,000.
    Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to
over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen
compared with 1985's 392,000.

1388,"Growth in oil consumption in the Western
industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct
this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International
Energy Agency (IEA) said.
    Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around
one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in
its Monthly Oil Market Report.
    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are
higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be
below last year's 3.6 pct, it said.
    The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices
stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can
be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some
of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there
may be slightly less growth in transport fuels.
    IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at
428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.
This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.
    The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
the year which offset a reduction in stocks.
    It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell
by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the
year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but
a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.
    It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,
there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported
stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.
    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built
up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the
period.
    The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more
or less in line with consumption, after declining for five
years, the IEA noted.
    Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6
mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January
1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,
respectively.
    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April
1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to
94 days of consumption.
    World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln
bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.
    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5
mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from
centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.
    Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first
quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd
of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average
for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled
28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.
    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the
largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA
said.
    Saudi Arabia""s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd.

they are major producers, were excluded.
    The sources said, however, that Britain, the Netherlands

    The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would
probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle
said. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and
would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.
    OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of
16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and
retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord
based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.
    OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and
it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter
ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth
quarter.
    Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore
fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from
planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained
within its December accord on output and prices.
    Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around
840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln
bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.
    The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since
February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.
    Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for
a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement
on the latest oil production cutbacks.
    Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC
producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia
and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep
prices stable.
    Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an
OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around
18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.
    Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export
earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price
during the first half of 1986.
    But firmer oil prices since then have brought some
stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade
deficit.
     Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently
refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to
the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.

production and sales have not changed despite Peru's decision
last week to freeze its silver sales, government mining and

change was in the works.
    Mexico is the world's leading silver producer and had an
output of about 73.9 mln troy ounces last year, according to
preliminary government figures.
    Peru, the world's second leading silver producer, last week
suspended sales of the precious metal in what authorities in
Lima said was an effort to protect its price in an unstable
market.
    Since the decision, Peruvian officials have said they will
discuss cooperation in the silver market with Mexican officials

    Last week, Peruvian central bank president Leonel Figueroa

bullet bond due 1995, which it priced at 100.8 pct at tender
today for an effective yield of 6.12 pct.
    The ministry accepted 50 pct of bids at the issue price.
Higher bids were met in full.
    The loan, which has a May 1 coupon and paydate, will go
towards the government's financing of an estimated 1987
borrowing requirement of about 42 billion guilders.
    The 1987 budget deficit is some 29 billion guilders and
early repayments on state loans are estimated at 13 billion.
    Because of projected early redemptions to the state of
loans by building corporations, analysts predict the state has
to raise 32 billion guilders on the capital markets this year,
of which it has found 4.5 billion guilders on the private
placement market.
   The finance ministry described today's tender as successful
and said the amount raised reflected a change in market
circumstances since the last loan issue together with
international demand for guilder-denominated paper.
    Following today's tender, the fourth state loan for payment
in 1987, a nominal 10.55 billion guilders has been raised by
public issues, bringing the total raised this year to 18.55
billion guilders, or some 44.2 pct of the state's 1987
borrowing requirement.
    The previous state loan, a 6.25 pct issue due 1998/2002
last month, raised a mere 300 mln guilders.
    Analysts said the small amount raised on the last issue was
because it was a return to a split maturity issue, seen as only
attractive to domestic institutions, from bullet loans.
    The finance ministry said then the amount was low but noted
a number of unfavourable market conditions at the time.
    Bullet loans have only been permitted in the Dutch market
since January, 1986, as part of a financial liberalization
plan.
    Bullet loans have attracted considerable foreign demand but
have also given rise to worries their fixed repayment date
might interfere with intricate redemption schemes built up

1459,"Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220
mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports,
wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country
recover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said.
    But the French bank's plan, which would effectively
postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several
months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52
members of the loan syndicate.
    The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports was
ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take about five months
to repair at a cost of some 150 mln dlrs.
    President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total
damage caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that as
a result Ecuador would maintain January's suspension of
interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt.
    Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the
price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's
export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue.
    Many banks in the Paribas facility, although sympathetic to
Ecuador's plight, feel that emergency financial relief is a job
for international financial organisations and not for
commercial banks, bankers said.
    The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last
October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a
Latin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted in
August 1982.
    Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly
that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they
fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions
for Latin borrowers will be set back.
    ""There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel
it's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a
restructuring would look bad,"" one banker said.

1460,"British Airways is looking forward to
industry deregulation in Europe and believes it will be a
smoother transition than the turmoil that followed the opening
of the U.S. skies, its chief executive said.
    Colin Marshall told Reuters that Europe will phase in
deregulation gradually to avoid the problems created in the
U.S. in the late 1970s -- fast growth, unstable fares, new
carriers that went bankrupt and ultimately years of losses for
even the largest airlines.
    ""In Europe we have the benefit of learning from the
American experience,"" Marshall said. ""When you add that to the
conservative nature of the Europeans, it amounts to an approach
that is slower and more cautious.""
    Airline liberalization, as it is called, must first be
approved by the transportation ministers of the European
Community nations. This could come this month when the
ministers meet to take it up, Marshall said in an interview
during a U.S. visit to talk to airline industry analysts.
    ""As the largest airline in Europe, and with the
sophisticated computer systems we have to help us with yield
and load factors management, I think we have a very good
chance, if not the best chance, of doing well in a liberalized
situation in Europe,"" Marshall said.
    Airline market deregulation in Europe will open up new
routes between European countries, allow established carriers
to grow and permit new airlines to begin operations.
    It will also free airlines to fly more seats on any given
route -- something that is highly regulated now -- and to base
fares on market forces. Discount fares in Europe might even
become more widespread.
    ""We think liberalization will help stimulate traffic,""
Marshall said.
    Lower fares have been offered by British carriers since
domestic services in Britain were deregulated in 1984, he said.
But passengers taking return flights or from other countries
pay higher, regulated prices.
    Marshall said deregulation will spawn more European
airlines, possibly to be followed by a spate of mergers, as is
happening in the United States.
    Two airlines, Sabena and Scandinavian Airlines System
(SAS), are now discussing a merger. Their success ""might open
up Europe to further merger activity,"" he said.
    This is because an SAS-Sabena merger could be a test case
to determine whether countries are willing to allow landing
rights to be transferred from one carrier to another, he said.

1478,"A year after squeezing to power with a
narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques
Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations
choking the French economy.
    But France is still waiting for a promised industrial
recovery the government says will follow from its free market
policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But
so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year
and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct
in 1986, is uncertain.
    Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth
target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister
Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But
some government supporters say they fear time for an economic
miracle may be running out.
    The political clock is ticking towards Presidential
elections due by April next year.
    France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of
right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed
reviews from non-partisan analysts.
    For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at
newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding
achievement has been to launch ""a veritable intellectual
revolution"" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of
state control.
    ""The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad --
but set in their context of structural reforms, they are
excellent,"" Develle said.
    But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief
architect of the government's free market policies, may be
pursuing a mirage.
    ""The belief that economic liberalism will produce an
explosion of economic forces is ideological"" said Indosuez chief
economist Jean Cheval. ""Personally I think it's an illusion.
Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system,
from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible.""
    Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard.
Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls
have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been
pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely
popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks
and industries to private investors.
    Since December, nearly five mln French investors have
bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas <PARI.PA> and glass
maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA <SGEP.PA>, the first two state
companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion
franc five-year privatisation plan.
    Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of
capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has
flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift
the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since
December.
    At the end of last year the government abolished price
controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car
repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small
businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.
    The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices
in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the
official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or
less.
    ""But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you
consider that prices are now free for the first time since
1945,"" commented Develle of Paribas.
    Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's
foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1
billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and
down from 153.3 billion in 1985.
    But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a
gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French
franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating
three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second
since Chirac took power.
    A recent report by the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for
failing to produce the goods that its potential customers
wanted.
    Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology
sectors, French industrial goods were ""increasingly ill-adapted
to demand"" and over-priced, the report said.
    French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed
with the report. ""One of the assumptions of the government is
that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and
modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like
freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,"" he said.
    And despite rising industrial investment and the
introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment,
the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7
million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.
    The problem for the government is that there may be little
more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.
    French producers failed more than most to take advantage of
last year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the
shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like
West Germany and Japan, they say.

West German stocks, now considered one of the most attractive
buys around after having taken a beating for the past two
years, investment managers said.
    Although the Frankfurt stock market is one of the world's
largest in capitalisation, wealthy Japanese institutions view
it as too small. They also worry about venturing into a market
from which British investors have recently bailed out, they
said.
    ""There's not enough turnover there to absorb the amount of
buying Japanese want to do,"" one West German investment manager
said. There is a danger Japanese institutions may be unable to
liquidate their holdings quickly if the market takes a sudden
downturn, he added.
    ""Japanese familiarity with West German stocks is also
limited,"" another investment manager said. ""They know the blue
chips, but there are too many other names they don't know.""
    The recent rapid advance of the Tokyo stock market has also
deterred Japanese from wandering off to markets abroad,
investment managers said.
    Japanese fund managers are afraid of criticism if they buy
into unsure overseas markets while the market at home continues
to advance, said Seiji Yamamoto, senior manager at Dresdner ABD
Securities Ltd's Tokyo branch.
    If gains from investments abroad lag behind those possible
from the Tokyo market, they could face difficulty explaining
their funds' performance, he added.
    The Frankfurt market's 15 pct depreciation just since the
beginning of this year has also been causing Japanese investors
to turn away, one investment manager said.
    The Frankfurt slump stems from expectations of slow
corporate growth due to the mark's strength against the dollar
and a withdrawal of funds by British institutions just before
the London market's liberalisation last year, the investment
manager said. ""Right now Japanese investors are taking a
wait-and-see attitude while the condition of the market remains
unfavourable,"" he said.
    Although there has been some nibbling of West German
stocks, particularly last week, most of the buys were for
short-term trades rather than long-term investments, an
investment advisor at a West German firm said.
    Investment managers believe, however, that genuine interest
in West German stocks could develop within the next three to
six months.
    Japanese fund managers still favour the New York and the
London markets over the Frankfurt market but they are
interested in diversifying some of their funds, they said.
    Some managers have been travelling in Europe, looking for
new opportunities, and are unlikely to ignore West German
stocks, especially with the average price/earnings ratio at
about 11, they said.
    The Frankfurt ratio compares with about 16 for the U.S. And
London markets and 52 for the Japanese market, Guenter
Kirchhain, first vice president for Deutsche Bank AG said.
    ""This mismatching will sooner or later generate an enormous
alignment potential,"" he said. The West German market could
reasonably have an average price/earnings ratio of around 16,
he added.
    Japanese investment plans may soon become clearer as many
institutions begin their new business years in April, he said.
    However, one fund manager does not agree that new
investment in West Germany will come that soon.
    ""Japanese do not buy into a market with declining
fundamentals,"" he said. When West Germany's fundamental economic
indicators appear to have bottomed out, that will be the
turning point for their investments, he added.
    Another manager said the Japanese are waiting to see the
investment trends set by U.S. And British investors in the West
German market.

    Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7
billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreign
currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of
balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.
    Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business
chiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which is
effectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wiped
some 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.
    Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from
the bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said
that it came close to one mln stg.
    On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct
to 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed
8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.
    According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to
lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct.
Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state.

1489,"A leaf disease affecting seven pct of
Sri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and
raise currently depressed prices, industry officials and
researchers told Reuters.
    About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber
Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus
""corenes pora"" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the
leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago.
    Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the
crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.
Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000
tonnes.
    Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber
clones if no immediate action is taken.
    ""The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees
seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use
chemicals to kill the disease,"" an Institute spokesman said.
    Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at
Padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the
fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State
Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.
    The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber
land with the balance belonging to small private producers with
a total of 145,600 hectares.
    The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research
Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for
planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these
clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older
PBX Malaysian clones.
    Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided
to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be
treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken.
    Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week
but prices had hit their lowest since last December. ""If there
is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise,"" a spokesman
for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said.
    Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about
four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe
one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this
week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same
period.
    Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average
of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in
December because of wintering in early February in producing
areas.
    Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with
the supply position showing improvements.
    Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last
month did not raise prices as on previous occasions.
    ""Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks,
meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of
the rubber we already had,"" one buyer said.
    Other sources said there were few forward contracts and
speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals
aggravated the problem.
    European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter
closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would
ease further.
    They said another problem that could hit the industry is
the dry spell in producing areas. ""If the inter-monsoonal rains
expected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further
shortages,"" one official said.
    ""But this again could benefit prices,"" a buyer said.

with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of the
U.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around
America's record trade deficit.
    ""Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the
challenge to our high technology industries, the threat of
government nutured competition, and the multitude of barriers
to our exports,"" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said.
    ""If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade
problems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,""
the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee
hearing on the trade bill.
    Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, have
made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging
bill is being readied for probable House approval next month.
    Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs
in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14
billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January.
    Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade
deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to
the dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to
press Japan to buy more U.S. goods.
    They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration
in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology.
    In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S.
semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he
intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese
electronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by
a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.
    Congress also has been been angered by the administration's
lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues
including beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications
goods, and financial services.
    The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in
four committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and
measures to force the administration take tough action against
foreign trade barriers and unfair competition.
    Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many
cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese
products or make them more expensive with higher duties.
    The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House
Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to
force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign
competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win
temporary relief from surges in imports.
    The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict
imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not
buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.
    Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant
from Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key
Democrats to press for passage of the amendment.
    The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West
Germany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does
not reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would
set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per
cent a year for three years.
    ""I'm tired of going into companies and having managers say
to me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can't
compete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be taken
away from American business,"" Gephardt said.
    The administration has said it could not support a trade
bill containing such a provision.

    U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee
while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks, he said,
adding ""This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks.""
The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983,
however.
    Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese and
European banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt
an approach involving separate discussions with the regions.

case-by-case basis, ""Perhaps the same principle should apply to

payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed
last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited
by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.

Washington talking to government officials and international
agencies and will this week visit Britain, France, West
Germany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions with
governments.
    Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and

    Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around
8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K.
The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan.
    The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus, its chief

    ""It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect,

    Since taking office a year ago, Chirac has been obliged to

    During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in
Libya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S.
Planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take a
circuitous route. That angered Washington.
    The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said a

enough action against terrorism. ""Now they are. We're pleased
and they are pleased that we are pleased,"" one said.
    More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grain
markets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European
Community  threatened to become a trade war.
    In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate
Community moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States was
poised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food
imports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute.
    Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad,
supported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored a
major success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases
in northern Chad.
    A French official added: ""There is also a common interest in
getting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the

countries, many irritants remain. At the top of the list is the

Abu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their
business, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from
the Arab world to London.
    The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Association
also comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf
currency system is more real that at any time this decade.
    Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these
issues, and the slide of the Lebanese pound, can be expected to
be major talking points.
    About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks --
including some in London and other major non-Arab financial
centres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins
on on Saturday.
    Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a
growing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market,
by far the largest in the region, is being carried out in
London.
    The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia's 11 banks,
foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in
Bahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based
banks are boosting their treasury operations in London.
    As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade
finance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrain
ran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K.
Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island.
    The two major Bahrain-based international banks, <Arab
Banking Corp> and <Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased
their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading
representative offices to branch status to allow dealing.
    One economist said: ""It is cheaper to run a riyal book in
London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain...
There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London.""
    Jeddah-based <Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposit
taker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia,
<National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November
1986.
    The major market maker has traditionally been London-based
consortium bank <Saudi International Bank> but the kingdom
joint-venture <Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded its
London operation to deposit taker status in mid-February.
    One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: ""Inevitably the
volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new
licences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most
of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia.""
    Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi
riyal market is difficult to quantify.
    Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency
deposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped
to the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986
from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion.
    The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal
trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very
quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now
staff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect
<Arab National Bank> to step up London operations.
    Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market
moving completely out of the region, partly because of local
demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian
Monetary Agency's (SAMA) desire to moderate
internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue
speculation.
    There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market
shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain
and London is still limited.
    But for the first time since the formation of the six
nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs
that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon.
    Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final
currency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
    But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary
System style with a common peg have been discussed at high
level and could be a topic on the GCC's annual summit expected
to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year.
    One dealer said: ""A lot of exposure is being given to
discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the
end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.""
    One open question is that of a common peg for currencies.
    The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated
since the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently
linked to a basket of currencies while the other five
currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the
U.S. Dollar.
    Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation
against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies,
but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of
7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.
    Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued
slide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the
undermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks.

rocket third stage starter motor on Monday but there should be
little or no delay in the launch program, Arianespace said.
    A joint statement from the European Arianespace consortium
and the motor manufacturer Societe Europeenne de Propulsion
(SEP) said that to avoid any risk, the motor had been
dismantled and could not be used in the next launch.
    It had immediately been replaced by another motor and new
tests had begun today.
    ""In these conditions, the flight V19 remains scheduled
before the end of June,"" the statement said.
    Ariane launches have been suspended since an ignition
failure in the third stage motor last May forced controllers to
blow up a rocket in flight.
    SEP has been carrying out a series of nearly 50
simulated-altitude tests on the redesigned starter at its
tightly guarded plant in the town of Vernon, 80 km northwest of
Paris.
    The Arianespace-SEP statement said that during a test on
March 23, a fault in the preparation of the altitude simulation
chamber meant a component of the motor came under abnormal
pressure.
    Arianespace originally hoped to resume launches by February
this year, but a longer-than-expected test program on the new
starter motor forced postponement of the next launch.
    The total orderbook of outstanding launches for the
13-member European Space Agency's Ariane rockets runs to more

offers to Texaco both before the litigation commenced and

    Earlier this year, a Texas court of appeals upheld
Pennzoil's claim against Texaco, ruling that Texaco unlawfully
interfered with Pennzoil's merger agreement with Getty Oil.
Texaco subsequently acquired Getty.

rise.
    Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency

will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but

the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily

official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a
completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S.
Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government
officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down.

the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little
changed from the performance expected this year.

nearly one percentage point, he said.

policy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance

1560,"Additional capital inflows of 1.5
billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico's reserves to
about eight billion dlrs, director of public credit Angel
Gurria told reporters.
    Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improved
investor confidence and because a tight monetray policy has
forced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflows
totalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986.
    Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the
sake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool of
funds available for badly needed investment.
    Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is
drawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only have
enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or
five months, Gurria noted.
    Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on
the commercial banks' 1.2 billion dlr investment-support
contingency facility. That money will be available until April
1988 if Mexico's export receipts and the price of oil fall
below certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for the
first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria said
today, ""We expect we'll never have to use it.""
    Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on
the second contingency facility included in the bank financing
package - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the World
Bank.
    Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed
yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the
development of exports of manufactured goods.
    He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billion
dlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil and
export promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month.
    Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from its
International Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few days
based on a successful review of end-1986 economic results.
    Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages of
discussions which will determine quantitative economic targets
for 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMF
for the rest of 1987.
    Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eight
bilateral accords with government creditors within the Paris
Club.
    Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrella
agreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrs
of official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalize
pacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks.
    In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement, he

Cooperation and Development have continued to provide export
credit facilities for Mexico, despite the debt restructuring.

1561,"President Reagan's move to impose
stiff tariffs on Japanese goods stems from deep U.S.
frustration over Japan's trade policy, and he has no intention
of calling off the sanctions, trade analysts said.
    U.S. officials put down any idea of delaying imposing the
300 mln dlrs in tariffs, despite seemingly contradictory
comments by some Administration aides.
    And, they add, a visit here next week by Japanese trade
officials and a visit to Tokyo by a senior State Department
official will likely do nothing to change U.S. minds.
    ""Do not expect the problem to be resolved or the sanctions
not to go into effect,"" said a senior U.S. trade official.
    Reagan last Friday announced that on April 17 he would
raise tariffs on certain Japanese exports to penalize Japan for
breaking a 1986 pact governing trade in semiconductors.
    The United States says the Japanese have not lived up to
their pledge to stop dumping semiconductors in third country
markets at less than production costs or to open their home
market to U.S. semiconductors. Semiconductors - tiny silicon
memory chips - are integral components of modern electronic
goods ranging from television sets and personal computers to
guidance systems on aircraft.
    Some U.S. officials had hinted that the United States and
Japan might come to terms on their semiconductor dispute in
time to cancel the planned tariffs, but this has now been
dismissed by other senior officials.
    They noted that negotiations over compliance with the pact
had been going on for several months, with little success.
    Japanese firms this week announced plans to cut chip output
and increase U.S. chip imports, but U.S. officials said Japan's
move was too late to stave off the American tariffs.
    The tariffs are to be imposed after a period of public
comment, but Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and other
officials have said neither the comment period or the U.S. and
Japanese trade talks will serve to delay the tariffs.
    Baldrige predicted the dispute would be resolved, but said
""I'm sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out.""
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that while he
hoped something could be done to hold off the sanctions, ""it
probably is not likely.""
    And U.S. Trade Represenative Clayton Yeutter predicted that
Japan would not be able to comply with the pact in time to hold
off the new tariffs on goods including personal computers,
television sets, power tools and electric motors.
    Trade analysts said that in any case, the U.S.-Japanese
semiconductor dispute was only one of many and trade frictions
that will continue until Japan ended a policy of predatory
pricing and opened its home market to foreign goods.
    Other disputes include Japanese prevention of U.S. firms
from taking part in building a new eight billion dlr airport
near Osaka and selling a wide variety of goods in Japan,
including many agriculture products.
    A new trade row has now arisen over a Japanese decision to
limit foreign participation in its telecommunication market.
    U.S. officials have said the American telecommunications
market is open to foreign firms and it was only fair trade to
open the Japanese market to 33 per cent foreign participation,
as Japan had previously agreed.
    Britain has also protested the Japanese limitations.
    American and Japanese negotiators are meeting to try to
resolve the issue, officials said, but there was no sign of any
early settlement.

    Japan is now in a major trade dispute with Washington, but
Kurihara told reporters the decision was not made in response
to outside pressure and described the project as a Japanese-led
program with U.S. Cooperation.
    President Ronald Reagan said last week that the U.S. Would
impose high tariffs on Japanese imports to retaliate against
alleged Japanese violation of a computer chip trade pact.
    The plane, codenamed the FSX, has been the focus of
competition between Japanese and U.S. Defence contractors. At
stake is an estimated 6.5 billion dlrs worth of contracts which
the Japanese government had previously intended to award to
domestic firms.
    The Ministry has said the plane, part of Japan's self
defence forces, will be equipped with high technology radar
dodging equipment, and will be able to fly at very low
altitudes. It will have a combat radius of 830 kms.
    The ministry plans to build 100 FSX fighters to replace all
77 of Japan's Mitsubishi-made F-1 planes by the 1990s.
    A defence ministry spokesman said the timing of the
announcement had nothing to do with escalating trade friction
between Japan and the U.S., Its largest trading partner.
    ""This is an objective decision, made after discussions with
U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger,"" he said.
    However, with two weeks to go before the U.S. Imposes
tariffs, Japan's ambassador to the U.S., Nobuo Matsunaga, told
Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari that Japan must address
individual market-opening issues, such as the FSX, defence

1593,"The government announced a three billion
franc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculation
among political and economic analysts that it is positioning
itself for a period of economic reflation.
    The package presented to the cabinet of Prime Minister
Jacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister Philippe
Seguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franc
contingency fund announced on February 25.
    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a
reflationary program.
    Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for
more than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third
of French unemployed, government figures show.
    The main measures of the employment program give employers
financial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at
least two years and stress retraining to help the long-term
unemployed return to the labour market.
    Training subsidies and exemptions from social security
contributions are the main incentives for employers.
    ""Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong
incentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour
market and that's why the proposals...Are costly,"" an aide to
Seguin said.
    The analysts said speculation the government is considering
a reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis
Baudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally
agreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy.
    He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out
economic stimulation despite the government's revision of its
1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8.
    Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin's
remarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate
the economy through a boost to consumer spending although
government policy allowed for increased industrial investment
from the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan.
    The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue
from privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt
and providing state enterprises with fresh capital.
    Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possibly
reflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on
social issues ahead of next year's presidential elections.
     Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of
strikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and
drove the government into a new mood of conciliation with
labour.
     Officials said that after the success of the privatisation
of Cie de Saint Gobain <SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas
<PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-year
privatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it
this year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in
1988.
    The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted
revenue to boost industrial and research investment and
spending on infrastructure such as the national motorway
network.
   The government also today revived a proposal, blocked last
year by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encourage
more flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by
improving the competitiveness of French industry.
    The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and
variations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put
to parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed
for procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of
State.

nations were told by New Zealand that the next international
negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this
century and the cost of failure could not be measured.
    Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a
welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great
progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which
must not be sidetracked.
    ""We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world
trading system,"" he said.
    ""We have seen that the failure of the world trading system
has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our
failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us
all,"" Moore said.
   ""The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last
hope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another
chance before the year 2000,"" he added.
    The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade
since the ""Uruguay round"" talks last September. The talks are 
also part of preparations for a full-scale June meeting of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice.

been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere
countries managing to have service industries such as banking
and insurance included in the next full round.
    The southerners' goal of including agricultural and
tropical products also was met.
    The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is
described by participants as informal and no declaration is
expected.
    Moore said one aim was to ""instil a sense of political
urgency to avert potential economic tragedy.""
    Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to
people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the
benefits, as well as preventing ""bush fires of confrontation
while we proceed with orderly negotiations.""
    The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations
including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.
    The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter.
    American sources say he is ready to state that the best way
to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to

    -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT

1616,"After an onslaught of new paper, fewer
mark eurobonds issues are expected this week, bankers said.
    Most managers said they were planning a low issue volume
for the Bundesbank's two-week bond calendar beginning today.
    ""We want to have a week's pause,"" one manager said.
    Last week borrowings totalled 1.775 billion marks,
including a 300 mln mark private placement for Deutsche Bank.
Issues for all of February rose to nearly five billion marks,
from 3.6 billion in January.
    The heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the very
best addresses were having to accept higher coupons.
    ""I think the D-mark market is still good, but only if you
can give a good coupon,"" another manager said.
    But even some government borrowers were not getting the
best reception for bonds which would have been taken up more
readily under other conditions.
    Of the three mark eurobonds launched on Tuesday alone,
bonds for Den Danske Bank and Iceland were trading outside fees
on Friday, although prices had recovered from initial lows.
    Den Danske's 5-3/4 1992 bond was quoted at midday on Friday
at 97.35/65 compared with its par price, and Iceland's 6-1/2
pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75 against a 100-1/4 issue price.
    A 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone was also depressed, but traded Friday within fees
at 98.15, 98.50 from its par price.
    Some shorter maturities did better. In contrast to the
10-year NTT and Iceland issues, a five-year six pct bond for
Hoogovens, traded at 98.40/75 from its 99-1/2 price, thanks
mainly to its shorter maturity, dealers said.
    The large amount of paper brought to the market in the last
two months has also led many syndicate managers to complain
about the Bundesbank's present fixed calendar system, which
they say is too inflexible.
    Currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to be
registered with the Bundesbank in the week preceding the
two-week issue period. A bank may decline to issue a bond on
the requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for the
next calendar period to schedule the bond again.
    Some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system.
    The Bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks
from four weeks last July. But few expect the calendar to be
completely abolished. ""I don't think the Bundesbank would give
that up,"" one banking analyst said.
    ""I wouldn't have anything against getting rid of the system,""
the analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating the
volume of new issues themselves.
    The Bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar
without trying to regulate the issues, but it needs the
registration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through
the euromarket, he said.
    For this reason, few managers here foresee the Bundesbank
sacrificing its present calendar system.
    Bond activity in West German bond trading and syndication
departments is also expected to be quieter than normal owing to
the carnival holiday.
    Carnival will close banks in Duesseldorf all day on Monday.
In Frankfurt, banks will close on Tuesday in the afternoon.

1628,"Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its
economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington
to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining
restrictions two weeks ago.
    Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown
of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of
hypothetical losses. Some of them are ""too sophisticated to
convert into financial terms,"" one banking source said.
    But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is
impossible to calculate.
    They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's
economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.
    ""Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-
achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only
contributed to largely internal, economic problems,"" one said.
    The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured
Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation
for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under
martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was
originally devised several years ago by the Institute of
National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning
commission.
    According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish
economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth
trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in
credits from Western commercial and government lenders.
    But the calculations were based on a time when trade was
booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing
the estimate as ""a theoretical projection based on a high point,
which has no real scientific evaluation.""
    A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to
the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs
annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were
imposed.
    Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to
200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade
surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs
against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.
    Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important
U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,
chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits
dried up for economic not political reasons.  ""Poland is
accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for
political reasons,"" said one expert. ""It's an illusion based on a
misunderstanding of Western economy.""
    ""There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone
who has no hope of repaying it,"" another said, adding that
Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits
in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.
    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as ""nebulous,"" one
diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders
and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of
scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the
lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact
on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs
and lacks the means to modernise its industry.
    ""MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not
be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to
regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are
in play now,"" said one Western envoy.
    He said Polish products were not competitive, and their
quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist
measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper
Poland's efforts to regain entry.
    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised
this fact recently.
    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, ""Making
up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly
difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of
two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of
exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.""
    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it
has a ""moral right"" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says
imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said
""The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing
of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will
just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing
Solidarity.""
    Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in
talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was
looking for a lead from the United States.
    He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its
financial obligations to the United States, ""but not in a short
time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its
foreign economic partners.""
    He stressed that the U.S. ""had a particular opportunity to
play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners
interested in the settlement of Polish debt.""
    Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed
Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and
Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and
said it should now play a more positive role.
    ""As a major superpower the United States can influence
international organisations,"" he said, citing recent meetings
aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to
which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

would achieve a trade surplus large enough to continue

    Speaking to reporters at the Brazilian Embassy, Funaro said
he would not seek approval of Brazil's economic program outside
his country, but added, ""At the same time we show credibility,
you (the banks) are going to have to trust us.""
    Asked if creditor banks would accept Brazil's refinancing
needs based on a new economic program not endorsed by the
International Monetary Fund, Funaro said, ""What other options do
they have?...They have to try to see our program.""
    Funaro, who is in Washington to attend the Interim
Committee and Development Committee meetings of the World Bank
and IMF, said he unveiled his refinancing proposals to the
major creditor banks in New York yesterday.
    According to Funaro, the creditor banks ""agreed on the need
to find a solution to the crisis."" He did not elaborate.
    Funaro said the commercial banks agreed on Brazil's need
for economic growth and added that creditors were aware that
Brazil cannot continue to export the 24 billion dlrs in net
capital that it transferred over the past three years.
    He also said that he told bankers about Brazil's needs to
ensure a seven pct average growth and eight billion to 11
billion dlr trade surplus until 1991.
    Administration officials familiar with the negotiations
said Brazil's new economic measures did not make much sense
based on current conditions in that country, and added that
they saw long and difficult negotiations ahead.

creditors will reach a debt rescheduling agreement before the
end of the year.

to put its economic house in order first.

spending and a sharp drop in exports.

1660,"German banking authorities are
weighing rules for banks' off-balance sheet activities in an
attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated
capital market instruments, banking sources said.
    Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are
under closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they may
resemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. To
Japan. Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank's division of
banking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-British
proposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate.
    But banking sources said West Germany was more likely to
produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals.
    ""There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latter
stages,"" one representative of the German Banking Association in
Cologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year.
    All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, West
Germany's four major banking associations and the Federal
Banking Supervisory Office.
    Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes
would require a revision of Germany's credit law, which has
been in effect since 1934.
    Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit
present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary
political process of changing it, banking sources said.
    Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited
banks' lending to 18 times shareholders' equity plus reserves,
on a consolidated basis.
    But lending ratios do not extend to several newer
instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts,
currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs,
currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currencies
and various innovative types of interest rate hedges.
    The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals
lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor,
and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swaps
than interest swaps. But even if German banking authorities
agree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on
how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk.
    U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series of
formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in
swaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial
intermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous.
This is the so-called market-to-market value.
    But German authorities are likely to consider this much too
complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of
lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of
the borrowers involved, the sources said.
    The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extended
to include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for public
authorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreign
banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers.
    A further complication is that the more flexible
definitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May put
German banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said.
    Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of
the U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S.
And British authorities, the sources said.
    One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated
foreign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, be
brought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despite
the fact that the risk may be entirely different.
    How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was
uncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status and
applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in
order to lead-manage mark eurobonds.
    But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lending
ratios will severely hamper foreign banks' freedom of movement,
particularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if they
are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet,
the sources added.

statements about its plans to build its No. 3 and No. 4 nuclear

for that is but a short step from saying that they should be
protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all,
the proprietors of the company,"" Leigh-Pemberton said.
    He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to
play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more
efficient market penetration. ""The degree of success or failure
(of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or
not the takeover was contested,"" he said.
    Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover
activity in the recent past. ""The aim is to pressurise a
company's management into action dedicated solely to a
favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly
or even primarily at the expense of the future,"" he said.
    Such bids ""often depend for their success on creating a
highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market,
and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to
engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are
immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders,"" he
said.
    In a clear reference recent events, he said ""those in the
City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest,
be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if
it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result.""
    They ""should exercise the most careful judgment at the

proved reserves fell to 511 mln barrels of oil equivalent at
the end of 1986 from 555 mln barrels reported in 1985.
    In its newly released annual report, Union Texas said it
replaced about 71 pct of its production of 56 mln barrels of
oil equivalent last year after taking into account the sale of
27 mln barrels of U.S. reserves.
    Union Texas, the nation's largest independent oil and gas
producer based on revenues, is a privately-held company owned
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co and Allied-Signal Inc <ALD>.
    The Houston-based company said it lost 57.5 mln dlrs on
1.26 billion dlrs in sales last year, compared to profits of
165 mln dlrs on 2.04 billion dlrs in sales in 1985.
    Union Texas said it received an average of 13.35 dlrs per
barrel for its international oil production and 2.99 dlrs per
mcf for its foreign natural gas sales. The majority of the
company's total energy production is in the United Kingdom,
Indonesia and Pakistan.
    In the United States, Union Texas said it completed

    ""Although significant oil reserves were confirmed,
development of this discovery will not be economical without
substantially higher prices,"" the company said.
    Union Texas said it planned to spend about 42 mln dlrs over
the next two years to develop its Eugene Island Block 371 in
the Gulf of Mexico.
    In 1987, the company said it budgeted 178 mln dlrs for
capital spending, less than half of the amount spent in 1985
and down from 199 mln dlrs budgeted last year. Union Texas also
said it would seek acquisitions of oil and gas properties as

1694,"International Business Machines
Corp expects its new products and cost-cutting measures to have
an increasingly positive impact as 1987 proceeds, chairman John
Akers told the annual meeting.
    Akers repeated his assessment of the company's outlook when
first quarter results were announced last week that ""although
the worldwide economic situation remains unsettled, we see some
encouraging signs.""
    He said IBM shipments in the first quarter exceeded the
1986 level, ""the first time that has happened since 1985.""
    Akers said that IBM will increase its emphasis on service
and support of customers this year and that by the end of 1987
it will have 20 pct more sales representatives and systems
engineers than two years ago.
    He said the company is accomplishing this by both moving as
many existing employees as possible into marketing and through
new hires.
    Akers said IBM will increase its U.S. software programming
workforce, both through retraining and hiring, by nearly six
thousands people over early 1985, to a yearend total of 26,000.
    Last year IBM announced that it would try to reduce its
workforce without violating its historical no-layoff policy
through early-retirement offers and retraining.
    Earlier this month, the company introduced a new line of
personal computers and this summer it will begin shipping a new
generation of minicomputers it hopes will compete successfully
against offerings from Digital Equipment Corp <DEC>.
    Akers said, ""We expect our product announcements and
resource-balancing measures to have an increasingly positive
impact as 1987 proceeds.""
    Akers said that since last April the company's worldwide
workforce has been reduced by 11,000.
    He said some 14,000 people have been moved from one IBM
location to another, headquarters staff positions were cut by
7,000 and the number of U.S. managers has been cut by 1,500.
    Akers said IBM is ""working hard to reduce our product
cycle,"" which is the time between the cenception of a new
product and its first shipment.

1702,"The 24 nations of the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by
sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic
growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into
deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.
    The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD
economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a
2.8 pct growth forecast in December.
    It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the
smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest
hit by currency appreciation this year.
    The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth
rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in
December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.
    It said it expected the OECD to post a current account
deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in
large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.
    It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to
fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in
1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.
    It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr
payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.
    The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50
dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18
dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes
increasingly ragged.
    It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in
foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its
trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last
year's 18.4 pct drop.
    The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year
and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break
through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in
1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.
    ""This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle
of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather
than a three-point landing,"" the EIU said.
    ""Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the
February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and
Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to
more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter
U.S. Fiscal policy,"" it said.
    It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the
willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government
assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.
    ""Thus far they have been willing,"" the EIC said, adding that
if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would
collapse.
    To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates
would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt
crisis, it said.
    On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look ""increasingly
sick.""
    Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen
slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to
4.2 pct in 1988, it said.
    The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest
single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a
sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in
December, the EIU said.
    On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West
Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while
Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.
Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more
competitively-priced dollar.
    It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and
oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.
    However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over
the current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices
will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first
time since 1984, the EIU said.
    After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of
internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in
1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said.
    It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6
pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986.

1730,"Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
said OPEC's December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18
dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there
was no immediate need to change it.
    Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news
agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three
mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC
quota.
    Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will
continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members
adhere to the pact, Nazer said.
    The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production
ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices
averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.
    Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki
Yamani last October, said: ""I do not foresee any need for new
measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting
will take place as scheduled.""
    Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all
members were abiding by its agreements.
    ""We've heard news every now and then of violations but they
were not at all verified,"" he said.
    OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a
13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near
18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.
    Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but
have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as
traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.
    Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its
4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.
    ""As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as
devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to
the agreement,"" he said.
    Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the
Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating
storage, Nazer said.
    King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and
Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price
stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful
competition with OPEC.
    ""Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly
desires price stability,"" he said.
    Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had
returned to a role of ""swing producer"" within OPEC.
    Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln
bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and
over-production by some OPEC states.
    ""Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played
by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8
mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other
members of OPEC,"" Nazer said.
    Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third
quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.
    But he said if circumstances changed ""I am sure then the
OPEC members will consult with each other and take the
necessary measures.""
    Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when
demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern
hemisphere spring and summer.
    Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation
from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union
agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after
he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.
    ""We did not ask any country to do anything. These were
programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market
conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing
conditions,"" Nazer said.
    He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate
-- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if
they saw fit.

bond yields before the 30-year yield could reach the
psychologically important eight pct level.
    But, with question marks hanging over the strength of the
economy and, more critically, the value of the dollar,
economists said the market remains fragile and will not quickly
recoup the ground lost in the past two weeks.

7.86 pct on Friday and a 12-month high last week of 7.93 pct,

    The Fed needs to buy a large volume of securities at this
time of year to offset the reserve drain caused by a build-up
of Treasury funds at the Fed around the April 15 tax date.
    The Fed confounded most economists' predictions of a bill
""pass"" last week by buying instead a record 2.2 billion dlrs of
notes and bonds, and Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc said the Fed could make it two in a row by offering to buy
coupon securities today or Wednesday.
    The Fed will not buy bills since they are already in
relatively short supply after heavy Treasury paydowns in
recent weeks, she argued.
    ""They haven't paid down so many bills before in a quarter,""
Ramirez said, noting that the Treasury has been able to reduce
the size of its regular bill auctions because of strong tax
revenues following the reform of the tax code at the beginning
of the year.
    Because it would be unprecedented for the Fed to conduct
back-to-back coupon ""passes"", most economists still expect the

ounces by 1991, compared with an estimated offtake of 2.88 mln

Matthey Plc said.
    Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisation

consumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largest
single application for platinum.
    Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces,
Clark predicted in his speech, the text of which was released

    Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest further
increase in investment buying and may well be cautious.
    He said South Africa was the most likely source of
additional supplies and will need to increase output by about
500,000 ounces to meet increased demand.
    The capital investment required to produce the additional
output would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the political
climate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said.
    The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the
1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,
Clark said.
    ""The very probability of a growth in demand set against the
massive investment required for expansion - and that expansion
only being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me to
conclude that the price of platinum will be substantially
underpinned in the medium to long-term,"" Clark said.

forecast another good year in 1987 in view of good growth in
both passenger and cargo traffic volumes early this year over

    The airline did not quantify its performance in early 1987
but said it would take delivery of one Boeing Co <BA.N> 747
freighter and one Boeing 747-300 passenger plane in September
and November respectively after it took a 747-300 last month.

1764,"Next year is likely to see a shortfall
in zinc concentrates of up to 100,000 tonnes, although there
should be ample supply in 1987, Shearson Lehman Brothers Ltd
metals analyst Stephen Briggs said.
    Speaking on the second day of Metal Bulletin's base metals
conference, Briggs said the major factor in his predicted
100,000 tonne shortfall in zinc concentrate supply in 1988 was
the imminent cessation of new mining and termination of milling
at Pine Point in Canada.
    However, this could be partially offset by some stockpiles.
    Nevertheless, despite this predicted shortfall there was
unlikely to be any dramatic change in treatment charges in
1988. The picture for 1987, on the other hand, was one of
record production of zinc metal with fewer strikes anticipated
in Canada, some improvement in South America and new capacity
in South Korea.
    ""Dramatic new record levels of concentrate output are also
expected in 1987,"" Briggs said.
    This would partly be due to a return to more normal levels
at existing mines in Australia and Peru, allied with
achievement of full capacity of 170,000 tonnes a year at Faro
in Canada.
    Looking further forward, the major event was the probable
opening in 1991 of the Red Dog mine in Alaska with a capacity
of 300,000 tonnes of concentrates a year.
    ""Once this mine is fully on stream it is unlikely that there
will be a major shortage of concentrates in the early 1990s,"" he
added.
    The picture for lead was also closely allied to that of
zinc, with no new dedicated lead mines planned and therefore
supply of concentrates largely dependent on by-products from
zinc mines.
    ""On this basis, our calculations point to a modest
oversupply of lead concentrates in 1987,"" Briggs said.
    The copper forecast, however, was for a record
non-Socialist output of 6.6 mln tonnes of concentrates in 1987,
increasing by a further 150,000 tonnes in 1988.
    Production of primary refined copper metal would also
increase, but not by as much as concentrate output, leading to
a moderate oversupply of concentrates of up to 150,000 tonnes
this year and with no shortages predicted for the rest of the
decade, he said.

measures to boost the economy is expected next month.

1769,"A single purpose company, <Italfunding
Ltd>, has been created for the purpose of obtaining funds on
the international capital markets to refinance 44.3 mln dlrs of
Mexico's official debt to Italy at very attractive rates,
Morgan Grenfell and Co Ltd said as lead manager and arranger.
    The transaction will be accomplished by Italfunding
obtaining a 44.3 mln dlr euronote facility in the market and
then using the proceeds to provide a loan for the same amount
to Mexico. The loan will be 100 pct guaranteed by SACE, the
official Italian export credit agency.
    Morgan Grenfell has used special purpose vehicles in the
past to help refinance export credits for other indebted
countries, such as Brazil and Ecuador.
    The Brazil financing, for example, involved the use of a
floating rate note. This transaction makes use of another
sector of the capital markets -- that for short-term note
facilities -- to finance a medium term credit.
    The financing is being arranged in connection with a
bilateral agreement between Mexico and SACE earlier this year
to refinance Mexico's official debt to Italy.
    The bilateral accord followed a multilateral rescheduling
agreement reached last September of Mexico's official debt to
the Paris Club of western creditor governments.
    The Paris Club accord, in turn, was part of a broad-based
rescheduling package covering 77 billion dlrs of Mexico's
foreign debt.
    That package -- heralded as the first to incorporate all
aspects of U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's plan to aid
indebted countries -- included a 7.7 billion dlr loan, which
was signed today in New York.
     The new financing for
Italfunding, being syndicated among about five major
international banks, will be a fully underwritten, revolving
facility with an average life of seven years and the facility
will fund the loan.
    All Paris Club agreements contain a generally accepted
outline for a rescheduling, but the specific terms must then be
negotiated on a bilateral basis.
    Banking sources noted that the use of a special-purpose
vehicle will provide Mexico with particularly attractive
financing at a rate of about 1/4 to 1/2 pct over the London
Interbank Offered Rate (Libor).
    The cost of the new financing compares with a spread of
13/16 pct on the loans in the new commercial bank package.
    This is because the intermediary providing the funds, in
this case Italfunding, can obtain its funds relatively cheaply
on the international markets. At the same time, the deal
benefits the banks, which will still get a reasonable return on
the note facility, which is pure Italian risk.
    The bankers noted that if the financing had been arranged
in Italy, the cost to Mexico and the Italian banks would have
been higher since the Italian banks would use a different
source of funding.

borrow before rates increase further.
    ""Corporate treasurers will continue to issue new debt when
they believe they are borrowing at an attractive rate,"" said an
underwriter with a major Wall Street house.
    Said another, ""We will not see a flood of new offerings.
Treasurers are reassessing the market. We will not see new
issuance dry up either.""
    Still, the pace of corporate borrowing in the public
finance market has slowed, according to a Reuter tabulation.
    Last week, which was shortened by the Columbus Day holiday,
saw issuance of 1.3 billion dlrs of new debt. That was down
from the prior week's tally of slightly more than two billion
dlrs of new debt.
    In contrast, a year ago it was not unusual to see those
amounts of new offerings in a single day as companies took
advantage of the then decline in interest rates to refinance
old, higher-cost debt or to expand operations via financings at
low, attractive rates, underwriters noted.
    ""Companies will conduct financings that they believe are
essential,"" said an underwriter with a medium-sized Wall Street
firm. ""But we will not see much more than that until the market
stabilizes.""
    In the meantime, treasurers will probably prefer shorter
term issues, analysts said. For instance, of last week's nine
issues, only one had a maturity of more than 10 years.
    The other offerings had maturities of two to seven years,
with most clustered in the two to three year area, according to
a Reuter tabulation. That is because single-digit interest
rates were had last week only among two-year securities.
    ""If people think that interest rates will continue to head
higher, then we could see treasurers rushing to market,"" said a
trader with a medium-sized securities house.
    ""But if people think last week's sharp interest rate rise
is a fluke, treasurers will sit back and wait for rates to
decline before issuing new debt, hoping of course that they are
not missing the boat by doing so,"" she added.
    Another impediment to new issuance is the lukewarm
reception to new issues by institutional and retail investors
in recent weeks, traders pointed out. Many investors refrained
from buying because they believed rate would rise further.
    ""We saw a lot of buying interest last week, but people are
not yet willing to pull the trigger,"" a broker said. ""They
would rather wait and see if the recent rate increase can be
sustained.""
    Conflicting forecasts on the likely direction of interest
rates did not help, analysts said. For instance, Henry Kaufman,
chief economist with Salomon Brothers Inc, said in his weekly
""Comments on Credit"" that the yields of U.S. Treasury bonds
would probably rise further because the marketplace expects
inflation to rise and the dollar to continue to decline.
    In contrast, Standard and Poor's Corp said on Friday that
prices of debt securities in the fixed-income markets would
recover. The rating agency said neither the economy nor the
dollar justify current high yields.
    Meanwhile, the Chicago Board of Trade is slated to hold a
press briefing on Tuesday in New York about its plans to list a
futures contract based on a corporate bond index.
    That follows last week's announcement by Commodity Exchange
Inc, Comex, that it plans to list on October 29 a new futures
contract based on the investment-grade corporate bond index of
Moody's Investors Service Inc.

forecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72
mln sown in 1986/87, Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF)
said in its first preliminary crop forecast.
    But there was no reason to expect Australian production in
1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year,
the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales and
Queensland suffered from poor yields last season.
    Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western
Australia while state average yields would be assisted by
growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said.
    The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a
poor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. But
in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided
that rainfall between now and June is not less than average,
AWF said.
    Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back
wheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since they
needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative
crops.
    ""The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds, pulses and
oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a
high proportion of growers' income,"" AWF said.

    The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins,

coins traded today at 906 marks, they said.

    He told a meeting of oil industry executives that oil
prices had stabilized at 18 dlrs a barrel -- the average fixed
price OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demand
have been in equilibrium since March.
    If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second half
of the year, prices will tend to increase, because non-OPEC
producers have not been able to produce more oil at current
prices, he said.
    But he declined to predict, when asked after the meeting,
whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mln
barrels at its next meeting in June.
    He said in his speech that world oil production over the
last two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day, or two
mln barrels a day less than world oil demand.
    Oil production by industrialized countries, particularly
the U.S. And Canada, is expected to decrease this year, but
some of that slack will be taken up by increased production in
Cameroon, India and other developing countries, he said.

producers and consumers in the industrialized world for the
upper hand in world oil markets, Subroto said in an earlier

1829,"The complex task of wielding control
over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global
economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the
newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says.
    Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the
making of monetary policy. But they would be given a much
greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert
Heller, who joined the board last August.
    He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but
argues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were
adopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the
volatility of exchange rates.
    Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of
commodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation.
    His idea, which many conservative economists find
appealing, has some backing among board members appointed in
recent years by President Reagan.
    It would complement the present system of opening or
closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation,
key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of
the money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to
changes in interest rates and affect economic activity
directly.
    Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept
is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary
policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid
base.
    ""What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can
serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary
purposes,"" says Heller.
    In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States
went off the gold standard because the global economy had
vastly outstripped gold supplies.
    A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of
hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest
producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa.
    The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early
1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world.
    But the current system of floating currencies in which
currencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the
monetary system, is also being widely questioned.
    Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a
formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when
currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are
major problems with this also.
    For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries
might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be
detrimental to their own domestic economy.
    Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can
make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree
with the fundamental judgement.
    The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference
to work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them
cope with their overpowering debt problems.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's
chief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called
Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a
forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other
economic matters.
   He appears convinced that officials from West Germany,
France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind
closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public
posturing.
   The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a
profound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and
international exchange rates.
    As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major
commodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together
and prices would be measured on a regular basis.
    ""In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might
be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary
policy might be eased,"" he says.
    He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction
markets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a
virtually continuous basis.
    Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and
traded on a world-wide basis, so ""that an index has a relevance
for the entire world,"" he says.
    In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the
production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all
production processes.
    ""Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive
indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures,
the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in
making their monetary policy decisions,"" he says.
    However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity
such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by
the OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system.
    He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow
monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity
to the rest of the system and to other commodities.

1834,"U.S. money supply growth is slowing
down rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of the
Federal Reserve's main monetary aggregates may even have
contracted in February.
    A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the
Fed, especially as it would follow a long period of torrid
growth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the
weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy
was justified on account of weakness in the economy.    
    M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reported
today, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminary
forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs.
The monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs.
    M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3.
With other components of M-2, such as money-market deposit
accounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage is
set for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say.
    M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional
link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of
falling interest rates and banking deregulation.
    But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is
likely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch
Economics Inc.
    ""The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they're all
sending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrows
at the Fed,"" McCarthy said.
    Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, ""We
have some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It's
coming in a lot weaker than I thought.""    
    The economists were quick to caution that one month's data
prove nothing, especially because money growth previously had
been so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct
rate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.
    Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be
explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the
booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a
slowdown in the business expansion.
    But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond
markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a
reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.
    McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with
signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter
progresses. ""Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as
they were a month ago,"" he noted.
    He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and
rises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.
    Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct
or less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate
enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national
product for the first quarter proved to be weak. ""You'd
certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past.""
    There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balance
sheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under
way, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line
with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.
    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc
argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to
solve America's most urgent economic problem, its massive trade
deficit. Because of the possibility that further dollar
depreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to
close the trade gap, Brusca said ""I'm not prepared to be all
that optimistic about the bond market.""

inflation from 440 pct in 1985 to 19.7 pct last year without
triggering mass unemployment.

perils awaiting countries who did not follow up on
stabilization programs.
    ""Continued rapid rise in wages would threaten the progress
in reducing inflation and the present level of employment,"" the
IMF said.
    The report echoed warnings last week by Bank of Israel
Governor Michael Bruno and the private Bank Hapoalim that
higher wages, government overspending and a consumer boom were
rekindling inflation. ""Though wage developments and the
reacceleration of inflation are worrisome, there is still time
to put the stabilization program back on track,"" it said.
    The warning comes ahead of Israel's key public sector wage
negotiations next month.
    Bank Hapoalim chief economist Petahia Bar-Shavit said real
growth of wages in 1986 was about 10 pct, following a fall of
between 15 and 20 pct in the second half of 1985 when the
government's economic stabilisation programme was introduced.

around 30 pct this year and a second devaluation might be

against the dollar in January.

boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export.
    Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to
reduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request,
they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks
of the first quarter.
    If that reduced production level were maintained through to
the end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pct
below that of the first three months of the year.
    MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said the
ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second
quarter cutback.
    One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in
Asia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets there
are picking up.
    MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese
semiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attempts
to ensure the success of the Japan/U.S. Chip pact.

1851,"Eurobond prices in the floating rate
note sector slumped across the board by as much as a full point
on some issues.
    ""Today has been irrational, irresponsible -- possibly the
worst day in what has been a dire six months for the floater
market,"" commented a senior FRN trader at a U.K. Bank.
    Republic of Ireland FRNs were marked sharply down in
initial trading and market nerves soon infected other
supra-national and sovereign paper with dealers attributing the
falls to aggressive professional shorting by a few leading U.S.
Investment houses.
    The FRN market has been suffering from acute contraction of
liquidity and consequent drain of investor confidence since the
effective collapse in the market for perpetual floating rate
issues late last year.
    Since then, FRN specialists noted that retail interest has
been sparse or completely absent and the stagnant market for
floating rate paper has become increasingly vulnerable to
manipulation, with nerves affecting all variety of borrowers.
    Floating rate debt of U.S. And Canadian banks came under
pressure last month when fears resurfaced about their exposure
to Latin American debt. Canadian banks were hard hit today.
    Fears about the Irish economy, exacerbated by recent
post-electoral political wrangling in Dublin, prompted a
sell-off of Ireland paper this morning with both dollar and
mark-denominated Irish issues tumbling by a full point or more.
    However, FRN dealers polled by Reuters felt the Irish
issues had been singled out -- as the U.S. And Canadian banks
were most recently -- as the market's most vulnerable sector.
    ""A handful of professional houses are targetting the weak
paper, shorting it aggressively and this is just starting the
domino effect with basically sound paper also starting to roll
with it,"" a senior FRN market source explained.
    Although floating paper from better-regarded borrowers such
as the U.K. Managed to finish the day only around 10 basis
points down, other sovereigns like Sweden and supranationals
like Eurofima suffered heavier losses, FRN dealers said.
    Debt exposure fears continued to undermine U.S. And
Canadian bank paper with one U.K. House citing a fall of 1-5/8
point on the day on a Royal Bank of Canada issue.
    FRN traders noted Japanese investors, initially
enthusiastic floating rate debt buyers, had lost confidence in
the market and speculated that a crisis meeting, such as the
one called upon the collapse of the perpetuals, could be
imminent.
    ""Retail clients just don't want to know about the floaters
any more so it has degenerated to a wily pass-the-parcel among
the professionals, all scheming to sweep the paper under the
carpet,"" another senior FRN trader said.
    ""I don't know what is going to happen to the market. It
can't go on like this,"" he added.
    In the fixed-rate sector, trading was dull with the market
still attempting to digest a heavy volume of new issues from
earlier this week although primary market activity slowed
somewhat today, trading and syndicate sources reported.
    Dollar straight bonds ended the day barely changed from
opening levels as investors failed to react on the unexpectedly
large 4.1 pct rise in U.S. February retail sales, prefering to
wait for tomorrow's producer price and business inventory data.
    A 100 mln dlr deal for Norsk Hydro was launched later in
the day and the issue was trading around its total two pct fees
at close of grey market trade although dealers said the
borrower's frequent appearance in the euromarkets could deter
investors.
    The Canadian dollar sector however saw good two-way trade
and a continuation of recent healthy volume as the Canadian
dollar rides high on the foreign exchanges and futures markets.
    Dealers said the strength of the Canadian dollar, which has
firmed especially over the last two days, has renewed end
investors confidence in the currency.
    A new Canadian dollar issue for Hydro Quebec was seeing
excellent demand, sector specialists said, and the issue was
quickly increased to a total of 150 mln dlrs from 125 mln.
    ""This kind of paper can be hard to sell and it is gratifying
to see such a high level of interest, both European and
domestic Canadian demand,"" commented one trader at a Canadian
house.
    Eurosterling, which has been in the limelight lately, also
on foreign exchange and currency bullishness, slipped slightly.
    Senior eurosterling sources noted that bond prices fell
back today, more or less in line with losses seen on the U.K.
Government bond market -- around 5/8 point lower at the longer
end of the eurosterling market.
    Dealers said overseas investors had not been buying today
and predicted consolidation before next week's U.K. Budget. A
55 mln stg convertible issue for confectioners Rowntree
Mackintosh was well bid at 104-5/8 105-1/8 pct and expected to
go well.
    Euroyen bonds showed a firmer tone led by some professional

1853,"Zambia has stopped sending its copper
exports through South Africa, the official Times of Zambia
said.
    The newspaper yesterday quoted highly placed sources as
saying the state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)
was diverting its mineral exports away from South Africa, but
it did not say which alternative routes were being used.
    ZCCM officials declined to comment on the report, but
Standwell Mapara, general manager of the Tanzania-Zambia
Railway Authority (TAZARA), told Reuters recently virtually all
Zambian mineral exports had been channelled along the TAZARA
line to Dar es Salaam for the last three months.
    During that period no Zambian copper had been shipped
through Zimbabwe to the Mozambican port of Beira - the only
other available route which avoids South Africa, Mapara said.
    Last December TAZARA carried 36,000 tonnes of Zambian
mineral ore, the line's record for any one month period, he
added.
    Copper, cobalt and other mineral exports account for 95 to
98 pct of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings and President
Kenneth Kaunda told Reuters in a recent interview it was vital
for his country to assure new outlets for them, avoiding the
traditional route through South Africa.
    Referring to Zambia's preparations for a possible cut in
economic links with South Africa, Kaunda told Reuters in an
interview on March 1, ""My main concern, of course, is the mines
because whatever happens we must continue to run the mines.""
    According to Mapara, TAZARA handled 1.1 mln tonnes of
freight last year and is still working well below its present
1.4 mln capacity. Kaunda said that once preparations had been
completed for evacuating Zambia's mineral exports on safe and
dependable routes his government would look to increase its
usage of TAZARA for other types of cargo.
    The 1986 annual report of Zambia's state-run Metal
Marketing Corporation said 81 pct of the country's metal
exports were channelled through Dar es Salaam last year, versus
79 pct in 1985. The report said Zambian copper production fell
to 463,000 tonnes last year from 526,000 in 1985.
    Despite the official optimism about diversifying Zambia's
export routes, diplomatic sources in Lusaka expressed
reservations about the capacity of Dar es Salaam and Beira
ports to handle all of Zambia's mineral exports, even if they
could be hauled there by train.
    ""The two ports cannot in any way and in their present form
handle the huge exports of Zambian copper,"" one western diplomat
said.
    ""A serious disruption in copper movement to the markets
could be brought about as it would pile up at the two ports
which lack the facilities and space to handle the copper
tonnage,"" he added.

1855,"The release of U.K. February trade data
showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376
mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes
of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.
    Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with
expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750
mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply
narrower than January's 527 mln deficit.
    ""The figures are unreservedly good,"" Chase Manhattan
Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said.
    Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker
morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index
against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from
yesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level.
    The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade
pattern would undermine international support for sterling,
which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K.
Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun
to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates
to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.
    But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.
    There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account
deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski.
    Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in
February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.
    Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.
    However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and
Drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would
prove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the
Chancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture
on imported goods.
    However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, said
his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit
forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion
stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.
    He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods
confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the
Confederation of British Industry.
    The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if
January's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas
goods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres,
Harwood said.
    U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2
point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries
about the figures evaporated.
    Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling
to a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher
than the European low of 1.5960.
    However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market
sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.
    Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was
largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the
Conservative government's support was slipping.
    The Marplan poll, published in ""Today,"" showed Conservative
support had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the
Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31
pct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party,
whose own support fell from 38 pct.
    The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted
enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left
the voters indifferent, political observers said.
    Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn
that today's improved sentiment could be dented if support for
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.
    This upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, which
are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming
general election, made them more sensitive to the trade data,
Harwood said. ""The news did come as a very, very substantial
relief,"" he said.
    However, on the interest rate front, economists caution
that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by
encouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had
already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in
response to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for
lower rates have been curtailed.

1895,"U.S. bank reserve, monetary and
discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve
today clearly indicate that policy is ""on hold"" and may not be
changed for weeks or even months, economists said.
    ""The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not
about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs
on the economy,"" said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co.
    ""These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in
prospect, nor do economic or financial developments argue for
policy change,"" said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc.
    Fed data released today were all in line with economists'
expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks.
    The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two
weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mln
dlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changed
from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that.
    It said that banks' net free reserves in the latest two
weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously.
    Finally, the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800
mln dlrs in February, with the broader M-2 measure down 1.6
billion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs.
    Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3
pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M-2 and actual
positive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M-3.
    February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and
20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits
set by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is
5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct. There is no M-1 target.
    ""In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for the
Fed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in money
growth,"" said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government
Securities Inc.
    Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary
growth in March after February's anemic growth rates. However,
they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to
prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the
economy shows evidence of weakness.
    Commenting on February's decline in the key M-2 aggregate,
Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money
market deposits at banks. This number has risen three to four
billion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February's
weakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2
and M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March.
    Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should return
to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so
continue to present no problem for the Fed.
    Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with
its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps
several more months of economic data before deciding whether or
not to ease its grip on reserves.
    Given the economy's fragility in many sectors, the analysts
agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose
to raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next
changes policy.
    ""Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as
low as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six
pct,"" said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pct
in the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week.
    The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of
customer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs on
Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it added
reserves directly through two-day System repurchases.
    Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate
be largely market-driven. They said it is focusing instead on a
borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs.

1898,"Preparations for the launch of a Swiss
options and futures exchange, billed as the first completely
electronic market of its kind, are at an advanced stage,
according to members of the project team.
    The Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex)
is a new departure in that it will introduce an additional
range of financial instruments and electronic trading methods
to the traditionally conservative Swiss market.
    There will be no physical exchange floor and both trading
and clearing systems will be completely automated.
    The new market, due to start operating in January 1988,
follows a series of innovations by the bourses in Zurich, Basle
and Geneva aimed at preventing loss of business in the face of
keen competition from London and Frankfurt.
    These innovations included the introduction last October of
continuous trading in major shares, plans to establish a single
continuously updated Swiss share index from next month to
supplement the various indices produced by the major banks at
the close of business, and experiments in electronic trade.
    Banks themselves last year took the initiative of launching
covered warrants on shares of other Swiss companies.
    ""If Switzerland wants to maintain and expand its
international prominence in portfolio management, our bankers
and fund managers must have the same modern instruments at
their disposal as their competitors,"" says Soffex president
Rudolf Mueller, a director of Union Bank of Switzerland.
    The computer terminals on which business will be conducted
will be confined to Switzerland. It is still unclear how many
Swiss-based institutions will seek membership of the exchange.
    Formal applications are not due until next month but a
preliminary survey completed by the Soffex project team this
week showed strong interest in membership.
    ""The response from both Swiss and foreign institutions all
over the country has been very encouraging,"" says Philippe
Bollag of the project team.
    Hans Kaufmann, who follows Swiss equities for Bank Julius
Baer, says a regulated traded options exchange should boost
foreign interest in Swiss shares and possibly increase bourse
turnover generally.
    The possibility of protecting portfolios by hedging should
attract Swiss institutional investors, Kaufmann added.
    Soffex is a private company set up by the five major Swiss
banks and the bourses of Zurich, Geneva and Basle.
    Trading will initially be limited to stock options on 10 to
15 leading Swiss bearer shares. An options contract on the new
Swiss share index should follow within six months but trading
in financial futures will be delayed until an unspecified
future date. Options on foreign shares may also be added later.
    Participants will be either brokers or dealers, operating
in the market through computer terminals in their own offices.
Trading must be conducted exclusively through the exchange.
    Exchange membership is open to banks, traders and brokerage
firms with an office in Switzerland, while clearing members
must be recognised as banks under Swiss law.
    The trading system, based on Digital Equipment Corp
software and hardware, provides display of best bid and offer
prices, matches orders electronically, allows anonymous
negotiation of block orders and maintains member order books.
    An ""interest"" facility, aimed at helping participants to
gauge the market mood, shows the number of users watching a
particular instrument at any time. Most of the electronic
clearing functions will be carried out overnight.
    Each contract will cover only five shares instead of the
100 shares normally traded on existing options and futures
markets in the United States, London, Amsterdam and Stockholm.
    This reflects the fact that Swiss shares often cost
thousands of francs. Bearer shares in F. Hoffmann-La Roche und
Co AG, likely to be on the Soffex opening list, were quoted
this week at 209,000 francs each.
    Contracts will initally be offered for the three end-months
following the trading date plus the subsequent January, April,
July or October end-months. Longer maturities may be added in
future if market liquidity permits.
    Detailed provisions have still to be worked out in areas
such as margin requirements, position limits, the supervisory
and regulatory functions of the exchange and brokerage fees.
    Banks polled by Reuters in a random survey were
enthusiastic about Soffex but reticent about the level of their
own involvement and about the exchange's prospects for success.
    ""We're moving into completely new surroundings and it will
require a change in psychology,"" said a securities dealer at a
major Swiss bank. ""We in Switzerland are not used to sitting all
day at a screen where nobody shouts at you.""
    Moving into traded options will also require considerable
investment in equipment and staff by participants. Completely
new dealing and back-office skills will have to be acquired and
some banks are already sending staff abroad for training.
